; uninstallOldVersion (installUtil.nsh) finds no UninstallString and
; returns immediately — bypassing the retry loop + "appCannotBeClosed"
; dialog that has no custom override hook.
;
; Safe because the new installer recreates all registry entries via
; registryAddInstallInfo after extracting files.
