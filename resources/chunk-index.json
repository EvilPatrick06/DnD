The randomness that dice\nbring often introduces the unexpected: an expert\nfails, a novice succeeds, or any number of other\ntwists. When a D20 Test or another roll produces\na surprise, the Dungeon Master often gives a fun\ndescription of what happened . If you're a player,\nlook for opportunities to interpret your character's die rolls and describe why things unfolded\nunexpectedly or even humorously.\nthey attempt during the game (see \"D2O Tests\"\nlater in this chapter). You roll a d2O whenever your\ncharacter tries to do something that the DM decides\nhas a chance of both success and failure. The higher\nyour roll, the more likely it is that you succeed.\nDAMAGE\nThe most common use for dice other than the d2O\nis to determine damage. When you make a successful attack roll (one kind of D2O Test), you roll\ndamage to see how effective the attack is. When you\ncast a spell, you might also roll damage .

You and your group determine how\nsimilar scenes play out in your adventures.\nFour adventurers-Shreeve, Mirabella, Auro, and\nGareth-have traveled to the Blood on the Vine tavern\nin the grim village of Barovia.\nJared (as OM): This tavern might have been finely\nappointed once, but it has grown shoddy with the\npassage of years. A blazing fire in the hearth barely\ngives any warmth to the room . You see a man\nbehind the counter, methodically cleaning glasses.\nThree older women huddle together at one table.\nAnd a handsome young man sits by himself at\na corner table, sipping a glass of wine. He looks\nup as you enter, but the other people ignore you .\n\"Welcome to Barovia,\" he says. He holds a coin\ntoward the bartender: \"A pitcher for the visitors.\"\nThe glint of silver catches the server's attention .\nMaeve (as Mirabella): \"Thank you , friend . May we\nknow to whom we're indebted?\"\nJared: \"I am lsmark Kolyanovich, though around\nhere, I am often called lsmark the Lesser.\"\nRussell (as Shreeve): \"That's unfortunate .\"\nJared: \"Indeed. I hope one day to live up to my father's example and rid myself of that title. And so,\nmy new friends, who are you?\"\nAmy (as Auro): \"I'm Auro.\"\nRussell: \"Shreeve.\"\nPhillip (as Gareth): \"My name is Gareth.\"\nMaeve (as Mirabella): \"I'm called Mirabella. You said\nyour name was Kolyanovich. Are you related to\nKolyan lndirovich, the burgomaster of this town?\"\nJared: He looks a little surprised. He says, \"Kolyan\nlndirovich is my esteemed father, yes.\"\nMaeve: \"Then he's the one who summoned us!\" I\nshow him the letter that drew us here.\nPhillip: I watch his reaction as he reads it.\nI Jared: He reaches for the letter but pulls back before\nTtouching it. \"That seal-it's not my father's .\"\nGareth, make a Wisdom (Insight) check.\nPhillip: Gareth got 18 .\nJared: You notice that lsmark is trying to conceal his\nterror. He's afraid to even touch the letter's seal.\nPhillip: I ask him what 's frightening him.\nRussell: \"Yeah, whose seal is it?\"\nJared: \"The Devil Strahd.\"\nAmy: \"Sounds like a pleasant fellow.\"\nJared: \"No! He is the vampire lord of Castle Raven -\nloft and a plague to my sister. You must help her!\"\nActive Roleplaying. Notice throughout the\nexample how Russell and Amy actively roleplay their characters' behavior. In this active\napproach, they speak with their characters'\nvoices, like an actor taking on a role. The\nplayers might even echo their characters'\nbody language. They still need to describe\nthings that can 't reasonably be acted out.\nDescriptive Roleplaying. Notice how Phillip\ndescribes his character's words and action.\nDrawing on his mental image of his character, he says what his character does and\nhow the character does it. If this approach is\nmost comfortable for you, keep these things\nin mind:\n• Describe your character's emotions and\nattitude.\n• Focus on your character's intent and how\nothers might perceive it.\n• Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with .\nDon't worry about getting things exactly\nright . Focus on what your character would\ndo, and describe what you see in your mind.\no~;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;::;;;===~\nAbility Checks. Phillip's character, Gareth,\nmakes a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether he reads lsmark's unspoken\ncues. Wisdom is the ability that measures\nperceptiveness and intuition. Insight reflects\na character's skill at reading other people's\nmoods and intentions. The OM set the DC at 15, which Gareth beats. With a successful\nWisdom (Insight) check, Gareth gleans information that wasn't obvious, so it wasn't\npart of the DM 's earlier narration. For more\ninformation, see \"Ability Scores\" and \"Proficiency\" earlier in this chapter and the Search\naction in the rules glossary.\n\nAmy: \"So Strahd wrote this letter, pretending to be\nthe burgomaster, imploring us to come to Barovia\nand rescue lreena Kolyana from a deadly affliction\nRussell: \"Why would he want us to come here?\"\nMaeve: \"Clearly, he doesn't think we're a threat.\"\nAmy: \"Well, he hasn't met us yet!\"\nJared: \"He's toying with you. He delights in the destruction of all things good, like my dear sister.\"\nPhillip: Gareth draws closer and compassionately\nasks lsmark whether his sister has been bitten by\nthe vampire.\nJared: Please make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to\nsee how well he responds to your pastoral manner.\nYou have Advantage because he's Friendly.\nPhillip: Oh, good thing. My first roll was a 7, but with\n5 is 15.\nJared: lsmark leans toward you, Gareth, with a suspicious glance at the other people in the tavern, like\nhe's worried they're eavesdropping. He whispers,\n\"The Devil Strahd desires to make lreena his latest\nplaything. Twice he has visited her in the night,\nusing his devilry to secure an invitation into the\nhouse-for he can't enter where he isn't invited.\nTwice he has bitten her, yet she clings to life. But I\nfear she won't survive another visit!\"\nRussell: \"All right, lsmark. You bought us drinks\nand told us about the Devil Strahd and your sister.\nHow can we help?\" dl  r.HAPT11111 I PLAYING THE GAME\nJared: \"You are too kind! First , I need your help\ntransporting lreena to the town ofVallaki.\"\nMaeve: \"Where's Vallaki?\"\nJared: \"It lies to the northwest, in the heart of the\nvalley. As the raven Aies, it is less than ten miles,\nbut the road winds among the hills and woods,\nand the journey takes at least five hours at speed.\"\nRussell: \"And why there?\"\nJared: \"The town lies beyond the view of Castle\nRavenloft, so I hope it's beyond Strahd's spies.\nAnd I have heard that Vallaki is well defended , with\na wooden palisade and iron gates.\"\nRussell: \"As if such defenses would stop a vampire.\"\nJared: \"Indeed. But if moving her there can keep him\naway from her for even a few days, we have time\nfor the second part of our task.\"\nRussell: \"A part where you help us?\"\nJared: \"Yes, when I help you face the vampire!\"\nf.) ,,.;;;;;.======;;;;;;;;;;;;;;=~\nInfluencing NPCs. Gareth takes the Influence\naction (see the rules glossary), which characters can take to influence an NPC. It's easier\nto influence an N PC who's already disposed\nto help you, as lsmark is here. lsmark's\nFriendly attitude gives Phillip Advantage on\nthe roll. In this case, Advantage made the\ndifference between success and failure.  0\n\nEX\nPLO\nRl'\nTION\nExploration involves delving into places\nthat are dang ero us and full of mystery.

The rules glossary defines the\nfollowing hazards:\nBurning\nDehydration\nTRAVEL\nFalling\nMalnutrition\nSuffocation\nDuring an adventure, the characters might travel\nlong distances on trips that could take hours or\ndays. The DM can summarize this travel without\ncalculating exact distances or travel times, or the\nDM might have you use the travel pace rules below.\nIf you need to know how fast you can move when\nevery second matters, see the movement rules in\n\"Combat\" later in this chapter.\n20  CHAPTER l I PLAYING THE GAME\nMARCHING\nORDER\nThe adventurers should establish a marching\norder while they travel , whether indoors or ou\ntdoors. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected\nby traps , which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which\nones are the closest to those enemies if a fight\nbreaks out.\nYou can change your marching order outside combat and record the order any way you\nlike:\nwrite it down, for example, or arrange miniatures to show\nit\nTRAVEL\nPACE\nWhile traveling outside combat, a group can\nmove at a Fast, Normal, or\nSlow pace, as shown on the\nTravel Pace table.\nThe table states how far the party can move in a period\nof time;\nif riding horses or other mounts\n, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the\nmounts needa\nShort or\nLong Rest before they can move at that increased pace again (see\nchapter\n6 for a selection of mounts for sale).\nThe\nDungeon Master's Guide has rules that affect which pace you can choose in\ncer tain types of terrain\nTRAVEL\nPACE\nPace\n Minute  Hour  Day\nFast  400 feet  4 miles  30 miles\nNormal  300 feet  3 miles miles\nSlow  200 feet  2 miles miles\nEach travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.\nFast. Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvan -\ntage on a traveler's Wisdom (Perception or Sur-vival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nNormal. Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth} checks.\nSlow. Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage\non Wisdom (Perception or\nSurvival} checks.\nVEHICLES\nTravelers in wagons, carriages, or other\nland vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a water-borne vessel are limited to the speed\nof the vessel, and they don't choose a travel pace. Depending on\nthe vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be\nable to travel for up to 24 hours per day. Chapter 6\nincludes vehicles for sale.\nEXPLORATION EXAMPLEThis scene finds the player characters investigating\na mysterious and potentially dangerous location.\nThey're moving through the environment and interacting with things they find there.\n\nu\nz\nr\nQ,\nThe charac t ers are exploring Castle Raven/oft, and th e\nOM describes the room th e characters have entered.\nJared (as OM): A blazing hearth fire fills this room\nwith warm light . Firelight glints off a poker beside\nthe fireplace , and the wal ls are lined with ancient\nbooks . A huge painting hangs above the mantelpiece in a gilded frame. The firelight illuminates\nthe portrait-an exact likeness of lreena Kolyana .\nPhillip (as Gareth): How old does the painting look?\nMaeve (as Mirabella): I'm going to check the books!\nJared: OK , I'll get to those in a second. Russell and\nAmy, what are your characters doing?\nRussell (as Shreeve): I stand near the door, sword\ndrawn , ready for danger. This place is creepy!\nAmy (as Auro): I go near the fireplace . A warm fire\nsounds nice. But I'm also alert for danger.\nI Jared: Got it . OK, Phillip, please make an ln_tel~igence\n(History) check as Gareth looks at the painting.\n'  Phillip: I don't have proficiency in History, but here\nJared: Two things leap out at Gareth about the painting. First, the woman's clothes look old-fashioned.\nSecond, the paint is flaking in places, and the\nwhole thing is covered by a thin layer of soot.\nYou'd say this painting is a few centuries old.\nPhillip: So maybe an ancestor of lreena's? Unless\nshe's already a vampire and this \"bitten by Strahd\"\nthing is a ruse.\nJared: Who knows? Now, Mi rabella's looking at the\nbooks?\nMaeve: Yeah, I pull one off the shelf at random .\nEveryone Is Accounted For. Exploration is\nopen-ended; the players don 't take turns\nmoving around the dungeon the way they do\nin combat . But the OM frequently checks in\nto make sure it 's clear where everyone is and\nwhat they ' re doing.\nTeamwork Matters. The player characters are working toward a common goal. They\nmove together through the dungeon and cooperate to overcome its challenges. When\nthe characters enter the room, they explore\ndifferent parts of the room. When Auro finds\na secret door behind the fireplace later in the\nexample, they come together again to examine it, and Gareth figures out how to bypass\nthe fire . It might seem like Russell's character wasn't doing much , but Shreeve was protecting the group by guarding the door.\nOo-i=========~\nWorth Rolling with or without Proficiency.\nYou usually have a chance of success on an ability check even if you don't have proficiency in a relevant skill. In the example,\nPhill ip gets a 20 without proficiency. The d20\nbrings many surprises to the game-surprises that the DM then interprets.\nC H APTER l I PLA Y ING THE GAME\n\nJared:\nIt's a book written in Common called On the\nHabitations of the Divine in the Celestial and Infernal Realms.\nRussell: Did you just make that up?\nJared:\nI'll never tell.\nAs you flip through the book, you notice it's very academic, almost impenetrable.\nMaeve: OK, I put that one back and pull out another.\nJared:\nAre\nShreeve and Auro doing anything else?\nj\nAmy:\nI grab the poker and poke at logs in the fire.\nO\nJared:\nAs soon as you lift the poker, you hear a grindI ing sound,\nand the back of the fireplace slides to the side, revealing a room behind it!\nAmy:\n\" Uh, folks? I found something!\"\nCan\nI\nsee anything in the room beyond?\nJared:\nPast the flames and smoke, you see a glimmering pile\nof co i ns heaped near a chest.\nl\nAmy:\nAnybody have a quick way to put out a fire?\nPhillip: And you laughed at me for preparing Create\nor\nDestroy Water! I clutch my Holy Symbol and\ncast the spell, drenching the fireplace.\nJared:\nWhat does the spell's description say?\nPhillip: It causes l 0 gallons of water to\nra in down in a 30-foot Cube, extinguishing flames there.\nJared:\nGreat! That puts out the fire. Without the light\nfrom the hearth, you ' re back to the magic glow\nof\nShreeve's sword, which casts your shadows\ninto the room beyond. But you can see\n, through clouds of lingering smoke, a closed chest on the\nfloor, surrounded by piles of coins. There are two\ntorch sconces on the far wall-  one holding\nan unlit torch with an int ric ate metal base, the other\nempty. A skeleton in broken plate armor is\nlying against that wall, with one hand at its t hroat and\nthe other holding the matching torch from the\nempty sconce.\nAmy:\nI check out the chest!\nJared:\nAnd the rest of you?\nPhillip: Gareth enters and looks at the skeleton .\nMaeve:\nI keep watch on this side of the fireplace.\nRussell: I'm still back by the first door.\nJared:\nAmy, the chest seems expertly made, with\nelegant fittings and clawed feet.\nAmy:\nI try to open it.\nIs it locked?\nJared:\nIt's not locked and opens easi l y-and it\nre leases a cloud of sweet-smelling gas .\nAmy:\nOh, no.\nJared:\nOh, yes . I need Auro and Gareth to make Constitut ion saving throws.\nAmy\n: Sorry, Phillip! I got an 8.\nPhillip\n: And a 5 for Gareth.\nJared:\nAs you draw this gas into your lungs, you feel\na ch ill gr ip you, and your bodies stiffen.

In those moments, combat\noften breaks out.\nTHE\nORDER\nOF\nCOMBAT\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two\nsides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries,\nfootwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes\ncombat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round\nrepresents about 6 seconds in the game world.\nDuring a round, each participant in a battle takes a\nturn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning\nof combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once\neveryone has taken a turn, the fight continues to\nthe next round if neither side is defeated.","tokenEstimate":2669,"keywords":["breaking","objects","action","you","can","automatically","break","otherwise","destroy","fragile","nonmagical","object","such","glass","container","piece","paper","try","damage","something"]},{"id":"phb-51","source":"PHB","headingPath":["Player's Handbook (2024)","Rules Glossary","Combat Step"],"heading":"Combat Step","content":"BY\nSTEP\nCombat unfolds in these steps:\nEstablish Positions. The Dungeon Master determines where all the characters and monsters are\nlocated. Given the adventurers' marching order\nor their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries\nare-how far away and in what direction.\n2: Roll Initiative. Everyone involved in the combat\nencounter rolls Initiative, determining the order\nof combatants' turns.\n3: Take Turns. Each participant in the battle takes\na turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round\nends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.\nINITIATIVE\nInitiative determines the order of turns\nduringcombat.\nWhen combat starts, every participant rolls Initiative;\nthey make a Dexterity check that determines\ntheir place in the\nInitiative order. The\nOM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical creatures, the\nOM makes a single roll, so each member of\nthe group has the same Initiative.\nSurprise. If a combatant is surprised by combat\nstarting, that combatant has Disadvantage on theirInitiative roll. For example,\nif an ambusher starts combat while hidden from a foe who is\nunaware that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.\nInitiative Order. A combatant's check total is\ncalled their Initiative count, or\nInitiative for short.\nThe OM ranks the combatants, from highest to\nlowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act\nduring each round. The Initiative order remains the\nsame from round to round.\nTies. If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order\namong tied monsters, and the players decide the\norder among tied characters. The DM decides the\norder if the tie is between a monster and a player\ncharacter.\nYOUR\nTuRN\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your\nSpeed and take one action. You decide whether to\nmove first or take your action first.\nThe main actions you can take are listed in \"Actions\" earlier in this chapter. A character's features\nand a monster's stat block also provide action options. \"Movement and Position\" later in this chapter\ngives the rules for movement.\nC H APTE R l I P L AY I NG T H E GA M E  23\n\nCommunicating.\nYou can communicate however you are able-through brief utterances and gestures-as\nyou take your turn. Doing so uses neither\nyour action nor your move.\nExtended communication, such as a detailed explanation of something or an attempt to persuade a\nfoe, requires an action. The Influence action\nis the main way you try to influence a monster.\nInteracting with Things.\nYou can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free,\nduring either your move or action. For example, you\ncould open a door during your move as you stride\ntoward a foe .\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you\nneed to take the Utilize action. Some magic items\nand other special objects always require an action\nto use, as stated in their descriptions.\nThe\nDM\nmight require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or\nwhen it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance,\nthe DM might require you to take the Utilize action\nto open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a\ndrawbridge.\nDoing Nothing on Your Tum. You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on\nyour turn. If you can't decide what to do, consider\ntaking the defensive Dodge action or the Ready action to delay acting.\nCHAlff ER I I PLAYING THE GAME","tokenEstimate":853,"keywords":["combat","step","unfolds","these","steps","establish","positions","the","dungeon","master","determines","where","all","characters","and","monsters","are","located","given","adventurers'"]},{"id":"phb-52","source":"PHB","headingPath":["Player's Handbook (2024)","Rules Glossary","Ending Combat"],"heading":"Ending Combat","content":"Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated ,\nwhich can mean the creatures are killed or\nknocked out or have surrendered or fled.

If you\nuse a grid often , consider writing your Speed in\nsquares on your character sheet.\nEntering a Square. To enter a square, you must\nhave enough movement left to pay for entering.\nIt costs l square of movement to enter an unoccupied square that's adjacent to your space\n(orthogonally or diagonally adjacent). A square of\nDifficult Terrain costs 2 squares to enter. Other\neffects might make a square cost even more.\nCorners. Diagonal movement can't cross the\ncorner of a wall , a large tree, or another terrain\nfeature that fills its space.\nRanges. To determine the range on a grid\nbetween two things-whether creatures or objects-count squares from a square adjacent to\none of them and stop counting in the space of the\nother one. Count by the shortest route.\nEvery foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs\nI extra foot , even if multiple things in a space count\nas Difficult Terrain.","tokenEstimate":359,"keywords":["difficult","terrain","combatants","are","often","slowed","down","low","furniture","rubble","undergrowth","steep","stairs","snow","and","shallow","bogs","examples","playing","grid"]},{"id":"phb-55","source":"PHB","headingPath":["Player's Handbook (2024)","Rules Glossary","Breaking up Your Move"],"heading":"Breaking up Your Move","content":"You can break up your move, using some of its\nmovement before and after any action, Bonus Action, or Reaction you take on the same turn.

When they fail\nthose saves, they take damage and are pushed, as defined\nin that spell 's description .\nDamage and\nHit Points. The skeletons have\nHit Points each, so the spells and attacks\nin this example deal enough damage to destroy them. If a spell or an attack dealt less\nthan damage, the\nDM would keep track of the damage each skeleton has taken until it\nis reduced to O Hit Points and is destroyed.\nSaving Throws. Gareth's Sear Undead is a\nclass feature (see chapter 3).

Some Sorcerers can't\nname the origin of their power, while others\ntrace it to strange events in their personal or family\nhistory. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a\nbaby's birth or the strike of lightning from a clear\nsky might spark a Sorcerer's gift. So too might the\ngift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of\nanother plane of existence, or a glimpse into the\ninner workings of reality. Whatever the origin,\nthe result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a\nchurning magic that can be passed down through\ngenerations.\nSorcerers don't learn magic; the raw, roiling\npower of magic is part of them. The essential art of\na Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that\ninnate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new\nand staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more\nattuned to its origin, developing distinct powers\nthat reflect its source.\nSorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce\nexactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most\nof the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke.\nPeople who have this magical power soon discover\nthat it doesn't like to stay quiet.

Your character can be any age that\nisn't beyond their species' normal life span.\nPARTS\nOF\nA\nSPEC\nI ES\nA species includes the following parts.\nCreature 'Iype. A character's species determines\nthe character's creature type, which is described in\nthe rules glossary. Every species in this\nchapter is\nHumanoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear\nin other\nD&D\nbooks.\nSize. Your character's species determines\nthe character's size. Individuals within a species cover\na wide range of heights, and some species include\nsuch diversity of size that you can choose\nwhether your character is Small or\nMedium.\nSpeed. Your character 's species determines the\ncharacter's Speed.\nSpecial Traits. Each species gives a character\nspecial traits-unique characteristics based\non the species' physiology or magical nature.\nWhen you choose a species, your character gets all the special\ntraits listed for it. Some traits involve making a\nchoice from a handful of options.","tokenEstimate":454,"keywords":["cies","when","oose","your","character's","species","you","deter","min","whet","her","character","human","memb","ntast","ical","such","dragonborn","the","peoples"]},{"id":"phb-494","source":"PHB","headingPath":["Player's Handbook (2024)","Wizard","Background Descriptions"],"heading":"Background Descriptions","content":"Sixteen backgrounds are presented in this section in\nalphabetical order:\nAcolyte  Guard  Sailor\nArtisan  Gu ide  Scribe\nCharlatan  Hermit  Soldier\nCrimi n?.\nM~\nr\nr.\nh\n:mt.

Hundreds of magic items are\ndetailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide , since the DM\ndecides when you find such an item. Here's what\nyou need to know about using magic items.\nI D ENTIFYIN G A M AGIC ITEM\nSome magic items are indistinguishable from their\nnonmagical counterparts, while others are conspicuously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to\ngive you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning a magic item's properties isn't automatic.\nThe Identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an\nitem's properties. Alternatively, you can focus on\none magic item du ring a Short Rest while being in\n232  C H AP T E R 6 I EQ UI PMENT\nphysical contact with th e ite m. At th e encl of the\nrest, you learn its prope rt ies a nd ho w to use the m\n(but not any curse the item might be ar).\nSometimes a magic item carri es a clue to its properties. The command word to a ctiv a te a r ing might\nbe etched inside the band, or a feathered de sign\nmight hint that it 's a Ring of Feath er· Fallin g.\nWearing or experimenting with an item can also\noffer hints about its properties. In the specific case\nof Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster\nwhat a potion does. Other item s might require\nmore experimentation. For example, if your char -\nacter puts on a Ring of Swimming, the OM might say,\n\"Your movement feels strangely fluid.\" Perhaps you\nthen dive into a river to see what happens. The OM\nwould then say you swim unexpectedly well.\nATTUNEMENT\nSome magic items require a creature to form a\nbond-called Attunement- with them before the\ncreature can use an item's magical properties.\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requires\nAttunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits\nunless its description states otherwise. For example,\na magic Shield that requires Attunement provides\nthe benefits of a normal Shield if you aren't attuned\nto it, but none of its magical properties.\nATTUNE DURING A SHORT REST\nAttuning to an item r equires you to spend a Short\nRest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same Short Rest\nused to learn the item's properties). This focus can\ntake the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon),\nmeditation (for a Wand) , or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the\nAttunement attemp t fails . Otherw ise, at the end of\nthe Short Rest, you're attuned to the magic item and\ncan access its full magical capabilities.\nNo MORE THAN THRE E ITEMS\nYou can be attuned to no more than three magic\nitems at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth\nitem fails; you must end your Attunement to an item\nfirst. Additionally, you can 't attune to more than\none copy of an item. For example, you can 't attune\nto more than one Ring of Protection at a time.","tokenEstimate":707,"keywords":["magic","items","adventures","hold","the","promise-but","not","guaranteeof","finding","hundreds","are","detailed","dungeon","master's","guide","since","decides","when","you","find"]},{"id":"phb-601","source":"PHB","headingPath":["Player's Handbook (2024)","Equipment","En Di Ngattune Ment"],"heading":"En Di Ngattune Ment","content":"Your Attunement to an item en ds if you no longer\nsatisfy the prerequisites for A ttuneme nt , if the item\nhas been more than 100 fe et aw ay for at least 24\nhours, if you die, or if ano ther cr eat ure attunes to\nthe item.

A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any\nsize, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that 's at\nleast level 2.

A duration typically takes one of\nthe following forms:\nConcentration. A duration that requires Concentration follows the Concentration rules (see the\nrules glossary).\nInstantaneous. An instantaneous duration means\nthe spell's magic appears only for a moment and\nthen disappears.\nTime Span. A duration that provides a time span\nspecifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, minutes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration\nentry might say minute,\" meaning the spell ends\nafter 1 minute has passed. While a time-span spell\nthat you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it (no action required) if you don't have the Incapacitated\ncondition.\nEFFECTS\nThe effects of a spell are detailed after its duration\nentry. Those details present exactly what the spell\ndoes, which ignores mundane physical laws; any\noutcomes beyond those effects are under the DM's\npurview. Whatever the effects, they typically deal\nwith targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all\nthree, each of which is detailed below.\nT ARGETS\nA typical spell requires the caster to pick one or\nmore targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A\nspelJ's description says whether the spell targets\ncreatures, objects, or something else.\nCHAP T ER 7 I SPELLS  2 37\n\nA Clear Path to the Target.\nTo target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so\nit can't be behind Total Cover.\nTargeting Yourself. If a spell targets a creature\nof your choice, you can choose yourself unless the\ncreature must be Hostile or specifically a creature\nother than you.\nAreas of\nEffect. Some spells, such as Thunderwave,\ncover an area called an area of effect, which\nis defined in the rules glossary. The area determines\nwhat the spell targets. The description of a spell\nspecifies whether it has an area of effect, which\nis typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder,\nEmanation, Line, or Sphere.\nAwareness of\nBeing Targeted. Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature doesn't know it was\ntargeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt\nto read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell's\ndescription says otherwise.\nInvalid Targets. If you cast a spell on someone\nor something that can't be affected by it, nothing\nhappens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to\ncast the spell, the slot is still expended.\nIf the spell normally has no effect on a target that\nsucceeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even\nthough it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the\ncreature is an invalid target).

You can permanently eliminate all memory\nof the event, allow the target to recall the event with\nperfect clarity, change its memory of the event's details,\nor create a memory of some other event.\nYou must speak to the target to describe how its\nmemories are affected, and it must be able to\nunder stand your language for the modified memories to\ntake root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details\nof your description.\nIf the spell ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature's\nmemory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold\nwhen the spell ends.\nA modified memory doesn't necessarily affect\nhow a creature behaves, particularly if the memory\ncontradicts the creature's natural inclinations,\nalignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory,\nsuch as a false memory of how much the creature\nenjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad\ndream.

While the Player's Handbook\nteaches you how to play the game and how to create characters who are the heroes of the story, the\nDungeon Master's Guide is written for the player who\npresides over the game and makes sure everyone is\nhaving fun. This player is the Dungeon Master, or\nDM. Being a Dungeon Master is a fun, empowering,\nand rewarding experience, and this chapter walks\nyou through the basics.\nWuat Dogs a DM Do?\nThe DM gets to play many fun roles:\nD  UNGEONS & DRAGONS IS A GAME IN WHICH\nActor. The DM plays the monsters, choosing their\nactions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM\nalso plays all the people the characters meet.\nDirector. Like the director ofamovie, the DM decides (and describes) what the players’ characters\nencounter in the course of an adventure. The DM\nis also responsible for the pace of a play session\nand for creating situations that facilitate fun.\nImproviser. A big part of being the DM is deciding\nhow to apply the rules as you go and imagining\nthe consequences of the characters’ actions in a\nway that will make the game fun for everyone.\nReferee. When it’s not clear what ought to happen\nnext, the DM decides how to apply the rules.\nStoryteller. The DM crafts adventures, setting situations in front of the characters that entice them\nto explore and interact with the game world.\nTeacher. It’s often the DM's job to teach new players\nhow to play the game.\nWorldbuilder. The DM creates the world where the\ngame's adventures take place. Even if you're using\na published setting, you get to make it yours.\nDM Tips\n‘The most important part of being a good DM is\nfacilitating the fun of everyone at the table. Keep\nthese tips in mind to help things go smoothly.\nEmbrace the Shared Story. D&D is about telling a\nstory as a group, so let the other players contrib\nute through the words and deeds of their characters. Encourage players to engage by asking them\nwhat their characters are doing.\nIt’s Not a Competition. The DM isn’t competing\nagainst the other players. It’s your job to pro.\nfun challenges and keep the story moving,\nBe Fair and Flexible. Treat your players in a fair,\nimpartial manner. The rules help you do this, but\nwhen you need to act as referee, try to make decisions that ensure everyone is having fun.\n‘Communicate with Your Players. Open communication is essential to a successful D&D game.\nMany problems can be solved or even prevented\nwith honest conversation. Ask questions and solicit feedback after or between sessions.\nIt’s OK to Make Mistakes. If you overlook or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move\non. No one expects you to memorize every rule or\ndetail. Even if you don't realize your mistake until\nafter a game session is over, it's OK to acknowl\nedge the mistake at the start of the next session\nand make adjustments moving forward.\nWar's New IN THE 2024 VERSION?\nThis is the 2024 version ofthe fifth edition Dungeon Master's Guide, Much ofthe book has been\nreorganized, expanded, and rewritten from the\n2014 version, and the versions ofthings in this.\nbook replace versions from older books. Here are\na few highlights:\n‘Sound Advice. Every chapter (but especially chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5) has new advice for Dungeon\nMasters of all experience levels.\nTracking Sheets. Helpful sheets throughout the\nbook give you tools to plan your game and keep.\ntrack of your campaign. These sheets are also\navailable on DnDBeyond.com.\nEncounter-Building Assistance.  The rules for estimating the difficulty of combat encounters have\nchanged, as you'll see in chapter\nReady-Made Elements. Sample adventures in\nchapter 4, a campaign setting in chapter 5, and\nnew maps in appendix B make it easier to run a\ngame right away.\nExpanded and Revised Magic Items. Chapter 7 is\npacked with new magic items and old ones that\nhave been revised.\nBastions. Chapter 8  has rules that allow player\ncharacters to build, maintain, and enjoy their\n‘own strongholds.\nLore Glossary. In appendix A, a helpful glossary\nexplains many ofthe iconic people and locations found throughout the D&D multiverse.\nCHAPTER1|THEBASICS  5\n\nTHINGS \nYou \nNEED\nWhat you need to play hasn't changed much since\nthe game's first publication in 1974,\nRULEBOOKS\nAs the Dungeon Master, you need this book plus the\nPlayer's Handbook (which contains most of the rules\nof the game) and the Monster Manual. Your players\nneed access to the\nPlayer's\nHandbook, too, but they can share as needed.\nLet players know beforehand what books (other\nthan the Player's Handbook) they can reference\nduring a playing session. For example, it’s not appropriate for players to look up a monster in the\n‘Monster\nManual\n(or the equivalent digital tool) while fighting that\nmonster.\nIf you're running a published adventure, players should avoid reading that adventure so they don't spoil any surprises.\nA \nDUNGEON \nMASTER\nOne player has the special role of Dungeon Master.\nSome people love being the DM all the time, while\nothers can end up feeling trapped as the “forever\nDM\"\nfor their gaming group.\nThe\n“Group\nSize” section in chapter 2 discusses possibilities for sharing\nthe role of Dungeon Master among multiple players\nin a group.\nPLAYERS:\nPlayers who aren't the Dungeon Master take on the\nroles of the heroes, also known as the characters or\nthe adventurers.\nD&D\nplays best with four to six players in addition\nto the DM, but it’s possible to run a game with fewer\nor more adventurers.\nSee the\n“Group\nSize\" section in chapter 2 for advice on\ndoing so.","tokenEstimate":1381,"keywords":["dungeon","master's","guide","2024","you","and","your","friends","take","roles","tell","shared","story","while","the","player's","handbook","teaches","how","play"]},{"id":"dmg-2","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Finding Players"],"heading":"Finding Players","content":"‘Where do you find players?

A recap\nhelps players get back into the story. It also provides\nimportant information to players who missed the\nprevious session. You can provide this recap, or you\ncan invite one or more players to deliver the recap\ninstead, Each approach has benefits:\nDM Recap. Provide the recap yourself if you have\nspecific information you need to impart or if\nyou want the recap to be concise and focused on\nwhat's relevant.\nPlayer Recap. Let the players provide the recap if\nyou want to gauge what they think is important\nor learn more about what they're getting out of\nthe game. If the players miss any important details\nin their recap, you can interject a reminder.\nENCOUNTERS\n‘The bulk of a typical D&D session consists of a series of encounters, similar to how a movie is a series\nof scenes. In each encounter, there are chances for\nthe DM to describe creatures and places and for\ncharacters to make choices. Encounters can involve\nexploration (interacting with the environment, including puzzles), social interaction with creatures,\nor combat. The Player's Handbook outlines the general rhythm of play in an encounter. The following\nsections offer more detailed information on how an\nencounter typically unfolds, in three steps.\nSep 1: DESCRIBE THE SITUATION\nAs the DM, you decide how much to tell the players\nand when. All the information the players need to\nmake choices comes from you. Within the rules of\nthe game and the limits of the characters’ know!-\nedge and senses, tell players everything they need\nto know.\nPublished adventures often include text in a box\nlike this, which is meant to be read aloud to the\nplayers when their characters first arrive at a\nlocation or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. It usually describes locations\nso the players know what's happening and have a\nsense of what their characters’ options are.\n‘Whether you're running a published adventure or\none of your own creation, your initial description of\nroom or situation should focus on what the characters can perceive. You don't have to reveal every\ndetail at once. Most players begin to lose focus after\nabout three sentences of descriptive text. As characters search rooms, open drawers and chests, and examine things more closely, give players more details,\nabout what their characters find.\nThe “Narration” section in chapter 2 offers more\nextensive advice and examples of narration.\nSrep 2: Ler THE PLAYERS TALK\nOnce you're done describing the situation, ask the\nplayers what their characters want to do, Note what\nthe players say, and identify how to resolve their actions. Ask them for more information if you need it\n‘Sometimes the players might give you a group\nanswer: “We go through the door.” Other times,\nindividual players might want to do specific things—\none might search a chest while another examines\na bookshelf. Outside combat, the characters don't\nneed to take turns, but you need to give each player\na chance to tell you what their character is doing so\nyou can decide how to resolve everyone's actions. In\ncombat, everyone takes turns in Initiative order.\nSrep 3: Descripe WHAT HAPPENS\nAfter the players describe their characters’ actions,\nit’s the DM's job to resolve those actions, guided\nby the rules and the adventure you've prepared.\nSo how do you decide? Think through these\npossibilities:\nNo Rules Required. Sometimes, resolving a situation is easy. If an adventurer wants to cross an\nempty room and open a door, you can just say\nthat the door opens and describe what lies beyond\n(perhaps referencing your map or notes).\nObstacles to Success. A lock, a guard, or som\nother obstacle might hinder a character's ability to\ncomplete a task. In those cases, you typically call\nfor a D20 Test, usually an ability check. For example, a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check\nmight be needed to pick the lock, while a successful Charisma (Persuasion) check and some coins,\nmight be needed to bribe the guard. The “Resolving Outcomes” section in chapter 2 gives more\nguidance on how to use D20 Tests and other tools\nto determine the results of characters’ actions.\nRoleplaying. When the players interact with other\ncreatures, roleplay those creatures based on\nwhether they are Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile.\nImprovise based on what you know about the\ncreatures, their knowledge, and their motivations.\nThen bring these creatures to life as you describe\nwhat happens. (See the “Running Social Interaction” section in chapter 2 for more advice.)\n\nOne Action at a Time. The rules about actions in\nthe Player’s Handbook limit how many things a\ncharacter can do at once. Keeping those rules in\nmind can help you adjudicate situations.\nCombat. In combat, many situations involve attack\nrolls or saving throws. The rules of combat can\nhelp you determine the effectiveness ofa character’s actions. The “Running Combat” section in\nchapter 2 offers advice on combat.\nSpellcasting. If a character casts a spell, you can\nusually let the player tell you what the spell does\nand how to resolve it. If questions arise, read the\ntext ofthe spell yourself—how a spell is supposed\nto work is usually pretty clear. The general rules\nof spellcasting in the Player’s Handbook are also\nessential for resolving a spell’s effects.\nExceptions Supersede General Rules. General\nrules govern each part ofthe game, but the game\nalso includes class features, spells, magic items,\nmonster abilities, and other elements that can\ncontradict a general rule. When an exception and\na general rule disagree, the exception wins. For\nexample, it's a general rule that melee weapon\nattacks use the attacking character's Strength\nmodifier. But ifa feature says that a character can\nmake melee weapon attacks using Charisma, that\nexception supersedes the general rule.\nWhen narrating results, try to give a flavorful\ndescription while clearly communicating what's\nhappening in the language of the game. See the\n“Narration in Combat” section in chapter 2 for more\nadvice and examples.\nDescribing results often leads to another decision\npoint, which returns the flow of the game to step 1.","tokenEstimate":1585,"keywords":["how","run","session","this","section","explains","game","later","chapters","and","detail","combine","sessions","into","adventures","campaigns","recap","start","each","after"]},{"id":"dmg-10","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 1: The Basics","Passing Time"],"heading":"Passing Time","content":"The game has a rhythm and flow that includes periods of action and excitement interspersed with lulls.\nThink of how movies show time passing between\nscenes.

Learn to recognize the times when you can\ntake a break as the DM, and then resume the action\nas soon as everyone's ready.\nENDING A SESSION\n‘Try not to end a game session in the middle of an\nencounter. It’s difficult to keep track of information\nsuch as Initiative order and other round-by-round\ndetails between sessions. An exception to this\nguideline is when you purposely end a session with\na cliffhanger, where the story pauses just as something monumental happens or some surprising turn\nof events occurs. A cliffhanger can keep players intrigued and excited until the next session.\nIfa  player missed a session and you had that player’s character leave the party for a while, make sure\nthat there's a way to bring the character back when\nthe player returns. Sometimes a cliffhanger can\nserve this purpose: the character charges in to help\ntheir beleaguered companions.\nAllow a few minutes at the end of play for everyone to discuss the events of the session. Ask your\nplayers what parts of the session they liked and\nwhat they would have liked to see more. Take notes\non what happened and the situation at the end of\nthe session so you can refer back to those notes as.\nyou prepare the next session.","tokenEstimate":490,"keywords":["taking","breaks","when","you","finish","lengthy","combat","encounter","ora","tension-filled","scene","need","time","think","take","quick","break","give","your","brain"]},{"id":"dmg-12","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 1: The Basics","Example of Play"],"heading":"Example of Play","content":"These pages present a short example of play, similar\nto the ones in the Player's Handbook, to illustrate\nhow everything outlined in the “How to Run a Session” section works in practice. In this example, the\nDungeon Master is running an adventure (“The\nFouled Stream\") from chapter 4. The four players\nare Amy (playing Auro, a Halfling Rogue), Maeve\n(playing Mirabella, an Elf Wizard), Phillip (playing Gareth,\na \nHuman\nCleric), and\nRussell (playing\nShreeve, a\nGoliath\nFighter).\nThe DM starts by asking the players to recap the\naction ofthe previous session, most of which consisted\nof creating characters.\n\nJared \n(as \nDM): \nLast session, we met our four heroes in the little farming village of High Ery. Who remembers\nwhat happened?\nAmy: \nWe were at a village council meeting about\nthe weird stuff in the river making the fish inedible. We\nvolunteered to investigate.\nRussell: So we set out and followed the river upstream. \nAt the first fork, we met a treant named\nBorogrove who pointed us to a cave that was the\nsource of the polluted stream\nAmy: \nBefore he wandered off, he gave us a magic\nacorn, and that’s where we ended last week.\nJared: So now you're in this gloomy forest. Dry\nleaves rustle under your feet.\nYou're still beside the stream, which looks murky and unwholesome\nbeneath the shadowy trees.\nWhat do you want to do now?\nRussell (as Shreeve): We continue upstream? (The\nothers nod.) ed: OK, you make your way upstream for about\nanother hour.\nThe farther you go, the murkier and stinkier\nthe water becomes. Rounding a bend, you can see\na \ncave in the hillside ahead of you.\nThe stream tumbles from the cave mouth.\nThere are withered shrubs clumped around\nthe cave, apparently poisoned by this nasty water.\nPhillip \n(as \nGareth): \nInto the cave!\n@ Jared: Who's leading the way?\nRussell: \nI'll go first.\nJared:\nThe cave entrance is ten feet wide, with\nthe stream running right down the middle.\nDo you want to go single file or two abreast?\n© philip:  |  don’t love the idea of stepping across the\nstream. \nLet’s go single file, staying on this side\nof the water.\n(Everyone else agrees.)\nJared: OK, who's second?\nPhillip: \nGareth will go second.\nMaeve \n(as \nMirabella):\nAmy (as Auro): I'll  make sure nothing's following us.\nJared: \nOK, \nShreeve, as you reach the cave mouth, you hear the\nshrubs rustling.\nRussell: \nOh, should’ve checked to make sure nothing\nwas hiding in the shrubs!\nJared: \nIn fact, the shrubs themselves are moving.\nThey're not rooted at all—each one has two\nlittle legs and sharp claws!\nEveryone, roll\nInitiative.\nRussell: \nHow many shrubs are attacking?\n©  Jared: Six. Auro, what's your Initiative?\nAmy: \ngot a\n14.\nRussell: Shreeve goes on 5.\nMaeve: A natural 20 gives me a 21!\nPhillip: 19 for Gareth.\nJared: Mirabella, you're first.

Any in-game topic or\ntheme that makes a  member of the gaming group\nfeel unsafe (a hard limit) must be avoided. If a topic\nor theme makes one or more players nervous but\nthey consent to include it in-game (a soft limit),\nincorporate it with care, if at all, and be ready to\nquickly veer away from it if needed.\nCommon in-game limits apply to topics such\nas intraparty romance, sex, exploitation, racism,\nenslavement, and violence toward children and\nanimals. Limits can also apply to certain creatures,\nsuch as spiders, snakes, rats, and demons. It’s also\nimportant to discuss limits around what harm\nmight befall characters, including mind-control\nmagic, helplessness, and death.\nThat said, D&D is a game that has in-world conflicts and mayhem. Certain core elements of the\ngame are difficult to ignore. For example, taking\ndamage isn’t a limit you can work around easily.\nSimilarly, character death is something that happens from time to time, though the game has ways\nto counteract or avoid it (see “Death” in chapter 3\nfor suggestions).\nUsING THE GAME EXPECTATIONS SHEET\nThe Game Expectations tracking sheet is a tool\nyou can use to set expectations at the start of a\ngame and ensure the game is fun for everyone.\nBefore distributing the sheet to players, fill in\nthe two topmost boxes:\nGame Theme and Flavor. in this box, broadly describe the directi\nSee the “Setting Expectations” section for the\nkinds of information to include here.\nPotentially Sensitive Elements, If you know that\nsome elements of the game might run up against some players’ limits, list those elements\nin this box.\nSee the\n“Hard and\nSoft Limits” section for examples.\nOnce the above information is added, give a copy\nofthe sheet to each player. Players can fill out\ntheir sheets anonymously, but ask each of them\nto add the following information:\nLimits. Using an X for a hard limit or a  question\nmark fora soft limit, indicate any potentially\nsensitive elements that are problematic.

Limits aren't negotiable,\nand everyone in the group needs to respect\nthem.\nThe start of a campaign is a great time to\nhave this discussion, but further discussion\nis warranted each time a new player joins the\ngroup or when the campaign has a shift in\nstory or tone.\nSomeone might cross a line and need to be reminded\nof a limit, or someone might not think to\ninclude some of their limits in the initial\ndiscussion. \nPlayers can also discover new limits as the\ncampaign unfolds.\nCheck in with the group every few sessions to\nmake sure everyone's comfortable with how\nthe game i developing, updating the group's\nlimits as needed.\nShifting Limits.

A player is exhibiting antisocial\nbehavior in the game. How to deal with it is covered in the “Antisocial Behavior” section.\nPlayer Conflict. Conflicts between characters\nsometimes surface conflicts between players.\nThese conflicts are best handled away from the\ngaming table. Encourage the players to resolve\ntheir conflict outside the game. If that conflict\nkeeps arising at the game table, you might need\nto ask them to step away from the campaign for a\nwhile or leave the game entirely.\nRoleplaying. Conflicts between characters aren't\nalways bad. It’s OK for characters (and players)\nto disagree about how to deal with a captured enemy or which side to back in a brewing war. If the\ndisagreement gets too heated, take a break and\nperhaps discuss, out of character, how the players\nwould like to proceed.\nIf you can't tell which of these dynamics is in play,\nhave a conversation with the players about it.","tokenEstimate":1634,"keywords":["harb","and","sort","limits","beyond","the","general","themes","flavors","fantasy","you're","interested","exploring","your","campaign","it's","important","have","conversation","with"]},{"id":"dmg-23","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 1: The Basics","Respect for the Players"],"heading":"Respect for the Players","content":"Your players need to know from the start that you'll\nrun a game that is fun, fair, and tailored for them;\nthat you'll allow each of them to contribute to the\nstory; and that you'll pay attention to them when\nthey take their turns.

A saving throw makes the most\nsense when something bad threatens a character\nand the character has a chance to avoid or resist it.\nMost ofthe time, a saving throw comes into play\nwhen an effect—such as a spell, monster ability, or\ntrap—calls for it, telling you what kind of saving\nthrow is involved and providing a DC for it.\nIn other situations that call for a saving throw, it’s\nup to you to decide which ability score is involved.\nThe Abilities, Ability Checks, and Saving Throws\ntable offers suggestions.\nDirricuty \nCLass\nYou establish the Difficulty Class for an ability\ncheck or a saving throw when a rule or an adventure doesn't give you one. Choose a DC from the\n‘Typical DCs table based on the task’s difficulty.\nTypicat DCs\nTask  pc  Task  pc\nVery easy 5  Hard  20\nEasy  10 Very hard  25\nModerate  15  Nearly impossible  30\nThe task difficulties are explained below:\nVery Easy. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task\nwith little chance of failure. Unless circumstances\nare unusual, let characters succeed at such a task\nwithout making a check.\nEasy, Moderate, and Hard. These are the most\n‘common difficulties, and you can run your game\nusing only them. A character with a 10 in the associated ability and no proficiency will succeed at\nan easy task around 50 percent of the time. For a\nmoderate task, a character needs either a higher\nscore or proficiency to have a similar chance of\nsuccess, whereas a hard task typically requires\nboth to have a similar chance. If you can't de:\nbetween two levels ofdifficulty, choose a DC\nsomewhere in the middle, such as 17 or 18 for a\ntask that is a little easier than “hard.”\nVery Hard and Nearly Impossible. A DC 25 task is\nalmost out of reach for low-level characters, but\nmore reasonable after level 10 or so. Low-level.\ncharacters have no chance to accomplish a DC 30\ntask, while a level 20 character with proficiency\nand a relevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19\nor 20 on the die roll to succeed at a task of this\ndifficulty.\nIf you're setting the DC for a saving throw, don't\ngo lower than 10 or higher than 20. Ifa creature is\nthe source of the effect forcing a saving throw, use\nthe standard formula for calculating a save DC (see\n“Calculated DCs” below).\nCaxcutatep \nDCs\nFor some ability checks and most saving throws, the\nrules default to the following formula:\nDC =8  + ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus\nThis formula often sets the saving throw DC when\na creature is casting a spell or using a special abily, but it can also apply to ability checks that are\ncontests between two creatures. For example, if\none creature is holding a door shut, use its Strength\nmodifier and Proficiency Bonus to set the DC for\nopening the door. When another creature tries to\nforce the door open, the creature makes a Strength\n(Athletics) check against that DC.\nAnother way to handle similar situations is to\nhave one creature's ability check set the DC for\nanother creature's check. That’s how hiding works,\nfor example: a hiding creature's total Dexterity\n(Stealth) check sets the DC for Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find the hidden creature.","tokenEstimate":806,"keywords":["savinc","throws","contrast","ability","check","saving","throw","instant","response","effect","and","almost","never","made","choice","makes","the","most","sense","when"]},{"id":"dmg-50","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 2: Running the Game","Advantage and Disadvantage"],"heading":"Advantage and Disadvantage","content":"Advantage and Disadvantage are among the most\nuseful tools in your toolbox.

You tell them what\ntheir characters perceive, so it’s  important to make\nsure you're telling them important information\nabout their surroundings. The Perception skill and\nWisdom checks made using it are key tools for\nyou.\nThis section offers guidance to help you use the\nPerception rules in the Player's Handbook.\nWen \nTO CALL\nFor A \nCHECK\nAn important time to call for a  Wisdom (Perception) check is when another creature is taking the\nHide action. Noticing a hidden creature is never\ntrivially easy or automatically impossible, so cha\nacters can always try Wisdom (Perception) checks\nto do so.\nUsing Passive Perception. Sometimes, asking players to make Wisdom (Perception) checks for thei\ncharacters tips them off that there's something they\nshould be searching for, giving them a clue you'd\nrather they didn't have. In those circumstances, use\ncharacters’ Passive Perception scores instead.\nUsing the Investigation Skill. The Investigation\napplies to situations where a character is u:\ning reason and deduction to arrive at a conclusion\nabout something under examination. Investigation\napplies when characters are trying to figure out\nhow a thing works—how to open a trick door, how\nto get into a secret compartment, and so on.\nDon't use the Investigation skill to determine if\na character notices something—that’s the purview\nof Perception. For example, a successful Wisdom\n(Perception) check allows a character to find a  s\ncret door or something that betrays its presence,\nsuch as thin seams marking the edges ofthe door.\nIf the secret door is locked, a successful Intelligence\n(Investigation) check would allow a character to fig\nure out the trick to opening it—by turning a nearby\nstatue so it faces the door, for example.\nHippeN THINGS IN ADVENTURES\nSecret doors, hidden compartments, concealed\ntraps, and stashed treasures are common elements\nin adventures. When using such elements, if something is hidden, allow for the possibility that the\ncharacters might not find it. It’s  fine to hide extra\ntreasures or delightful surprises, but don't hide elements that are essential to the characters’ succe:\nplaces where characters might not find them.\nEven if  the hidden objects aren't  essential to the\nadventure’s success, plant hints that clue players in\nto the idea that there might be something hidden\n\nfor them to find.\nSuch hints can be subtle\n(a\ncharacter hears a strange rattle when opening\nthe desk drawer, suggesting the presence\nof a hidden compartment in the back or bottom\nof the drawer) or obvious\n(clear footprints lead across the room to\na\nblank wall that is actually a secret door).\nThese hints let players discover fun secrets\nwithout requiring them to spend extensive\ntime searching every square foot of every\nroom and hallway.\nPERCEPTION\nAND \nENCOUNTERS\nIf the characters encounter another group\nof creatures and neither side is being stealthy,\nthe two groups automatically notice each\nother once they are within sight or hearing\nrange of one another.\n‘The\nAudible Distance table can help you determine\nthe hearing range, and the following sections\naddress visibility.\nIf one group tries to hide from

The Encounter\nDistance column in the Travel Terrain table gives\nthe range at which creatures might become aware\nof each other while journeying through the wilderness. When staging an encounter, consider these\npossibilities:\nAmbush. Monsters set up an ambush along a route\nthey expect travelers to follow.\nAttack from Above. Flying monsters swoop down\nto attack the characters.\nDistant Sighting. The characters and monsters\nspot each other from a distance in open terrain.\nFound by Chance. The characters happen upon\nmonsters that are camping, eating, hunting, basking in the sun, walking along the same trail, or\nengaged in some other activity.\nPursuit. The characters are tracking monsters, or\nthe monsters are tracking them. The encounter\nbegins when the two groups get close enough to\ninteract.\nForaging. Characters without water and Rations\ncan stave off dehydration and malnutrition by\ngathering food and water as they travel. A foraging character makes a  Wisdom (Survival) check\nonce per journey stage (or once per day if a stage\nis shorter than a day). The DC is determined by\nthe abundance of food and water in the region, as\nshown in the Foraging DC column of the Travel\nTerrain table. If multiple characters forage, each\ncharacter makes a separate check.\nA foraging character finds nothing on a failed\ncheck. On a successful check, roll 1d6 and add the\ncharacter's Wisdom modifier to determine how\nmuch food (in pounds) the character finds per day\nof the journey stage, then repeat the roll for water\n(in gallons).\nNavigation. If the characters aren't following an\nestablished path or traveling with a landmark in\nsight, they risk getting lost. Here are some circumstances that can cause a group to lose its way\nBranching passages underground\n+  Horizon-obscuring terrain, such as dense forest\n+  Obscuring weather, such as heavy rain or fog\nTraveling at night\n+  Traveling at sea while unable to see the sky or any\nfamiliar land\nLet the players know when the characters are at\nrisk of getting lost, then have the characters choose\none of their number to make a Wisdom (Survival)\ncheck against a  DC appropriate to the terrain, as.\nshown in the Navigation DC column of the Travel\nTerrain table. Another member ofthe group can\ntake the Help action to assist this check as normal.\nIf the check fails, the party goes off course. You\ndecide what this looks like:  they might follow the\n\nwrong branch of a river, orient themselves to the\nwrong mountain peak on the horizon, or get turned\naround in the forest. As a baseline, assume that getting lost extends the length of the current journey\nstage by\n1d6\npercent.\nIt might also affect subsequent stages of\nthe journey.\nObstacles. An obstacle is terrain or weather that\nobstructs the characters’ path. Examples include\na cliff, a blizzard, or a forest fire. To get past the\nobstacle, characters might need to backtrack and\nfind an alternate route, or they might need to take\nshelter until the obstacle goes away.\nLet the players spend time thinking about a solution, then be generous in adjudicating whether their plan works.\nIn addition to the chance of a delay (adding a few\nhours, a day, or a couple of days to the current stage\nof the journey), here are some other consequences\nyou can impose if characters fail to overcome or\nbypass an obstacle:\nCombat Encounter, The characters encounter one\nor more Hostile creatures. For example, marching through a burning forest instead of circling\naround it might prompt an encounter with raging\nfire elementals.\nDamage. The characters take damage. For example,\na character who tumbles over a waterfall might\ntake Bludgeoning damage. See “Improvising Damage” in this chapter for guidelines on determining\nhow much damage is appropriate.\nExhaustion. The obstacle fatigues the characters,\ncausing them to gain Exhaustion levels. For\nDo Pavers NEED To Track RATIONS?\nYou  might  decide that tracking Rations is unnecessary in your game. Even ifthe characters are in\na desert, you can assume that a character with\nproficiency in the Survival skill can find enough\nfood and water to sustain the party. Make sure\nyou work that into your narration of the journey\nso the player feels good about choosing that skill\nproficiency. You can also assume the characters,\ncan load their mounts with enough Rations for\ntheir journey, or they can use magic\n(such as the\nCreate Food and Water spell) to sustain them.\nOn the other hand, having players track Rations\n‘seems appropriate for a more realistic campaign.\nCharacters in such a campaign should approach\na long wilderness journey as a challenge in logistics: how many pack animals do they need to\ncarry the food for the journey, and how do they\nfeed the animals?\nAs always, communicate your expectations\nabout these rules to the players ahead of time. IF\nyou don't plan on tracking Rations, tll your players that before they spend an hour purchasi\nsupplies for theirjourney.\n\nexample, marching through a blizzard instead\nof taking shelter might cause each character to gain\n1d4 Exhaustion levels.\nAnother\nCondition.\nThe obstacle imposes another condition on\nthe characters.\nFor example, wading through a fetid swamp rather than  skirting\naround it might impose the Poisoned condition,\nwhich lasts until removed by magic.\nSearches.\nThis challenge often comes up in the last\nstage of a journey: the characters have to find their\ndestination, which might be an island, an\nold mine, an ancient ruin, a magical pool,\na\nhag’s cottage, or some other feature.\n‘The Search DC column of the Travel Terrain table\nsuggests DCs for Wisdom (Perception) checks made\nto find something in different types ofterrain. You\ncan adjust these DCs based on the specific terrain\nfeatures and the nature of what the characters are\ntrying to find, using the guidelines for setting DCs\nearlier in this chapter.\nTracking. A specific instance of searching on a\njourney is when adventurers choose their\npath by following the tracks of other creatures.\nTo track, one or more trackers must succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check. You might require trackers to make a new check in any of the following\ncircumstances:\nResting. The trackers resume tracking after finishing\na\nShort or\nLong\nRest.\nCHARACTERS\nTRAVELING,\n‘THROUGH \nTHE \nwiLoeRNess\nShifting Weather or Terrain. The weather or terrain changes in a way that makes tracking harder.\nTerrain\nObstacle.\nThe trail crosses a river or similar obstacle\nthat allows no tracks.\nThe DC for the check depends on how well the\nground shows signs of a creature's passage. No roll\nis necessary in situations where the tracks are obvious, such as following an army along a muddy road.\nSpotting tracks on bare rock is more challenging\nunless the creature being tracked leaves\na\ndistinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time often makes\ntracks harder to follow. In a situation where there\nis no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is\nimpossible.\nUse the Search DC column of the Travel Terrain\ntable as a starting point for setting the DC for\ntracking. If you prefer, you can choose a DC based\non your assessment of the difficulty—higher if\ndays have elapsed since the creature passed, lower\nif the creature is leaving an obvious trail\nsuch as blood. You can also grant Advantage on the check if\nthere's more than one set of tracks to follow or Disadvantage\nif the trail passes through a busy area.\nOn a failed check, the character loses the trail\nbut can attempt to find it again by carefully searching the area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail ina\nconfined area, such as a series of caverns, or 1 hour\noutdoors.","tokenEstimate":1967,"keywords":["journey","stace","challenges","that","adventurers","might","face","duringa","stage","include","the","following","which","are","cussed","sections","follow","encounters","with","other"]},{"id":"dmg-68","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 2: Running the Game","Running Combat"],"heading":"Running Combat","content":"This section builds on the combat rules in the Player's Handbook and offers tips for keeping the game\nrunning smoothly when a fight breaks out.\nROLLING \nINITIATIVE\nCombat starts when—and only when—you say i\ndoes.

A monster's stat\nblock in the Monster Manual includes its Initiative\nscore after its Initiative bonus.\n‘Advantage and Disadvantage.

If you aren’t using miniatures\nor other visual aids, one way to track your monsters\nis to assign them unique features. For example,\nimagine that you're running an encounter with\nthree ogres. You might attach descriptions such as\n“the ogre with a big scar” and “the ogre with the\nhelmet” to help you and your players track which\nmonster is which. Once Initiative is rolled, jot down\neach ogre's Hit Points and add notes (and even a\nname, if you like) to differentiate each one:\nKing logren/ scat): 68\nThod logren/ helm): 71\nMut logre smeeredn/ dirt): 59\nIf you use miniatures to represent monsters, one\nway to differentiate them is to give each one a\nunique miniature. If you use identical miniatures\nto represent multiple monsters, you can tag the\n\nminiatures with small stickers of different colors or\nstickers with different letters or numbers on them,\nFor example, in a combat encounter with three\nogres, you could use three identical ogre miniatures\ntagged with stickers marked A, B, and C, respectively. To track the ogres’ Hit Points, you can sort\nthem by letter, then subtract damage from their\nHit Points as they take it.

Certain\ncombat encounters, however, can benefit from\nhaving visual aids or physical props, the\nmost common of which are miniatures and a\nbattle grid.\nMiniatures are typically used in conjunction\nwith model terrain, modular dungeon tiles,\nor maps drawn on large vinyl mats.\nMost virtual tabletops for online play simulate\nminiatures and grids in a digital environment.\n‘The following sections expand on the rules\nin the\nPlayer's\nHandbook for depicting combat using miniature\nfigures on a grid.\nTacticaL\nMaps\nYou can draw tactical maps with colored markers\non an erasable vinyl mat with\nL-inch squares or a similar flat surface.\nPreprinted poster-sized maps,\n‘maps assembled from cardboard tiles, and\nterrain made of sculpted plaster or resin\nare other options.\nIf you're playing on a virtual tabletop,\nyou can find abundant tactical maps in digital\nform online.\nThe most common unit for tactical maps is\nthe\n5-foot square, and maps with grids are readily\navailable and easy to create.\nHowever, you don't have to use a grid at\nall.\nYou can track distances with a tape measure,\nstring, rulers, or pipe cleaners cut to specific\nlengths.\nAnother option is a play surface covered\nby t-inch hexagons\n(often called hexes), which makes movement more\nflexible while keeping the easy counting\nof a grid.\nDungeon corridors with straight walls and\nright angles don't map easily onto hexes,\nthough.\nCREATURE \nSIZE \nON \nSQUARES \nAND \nHEXES\nTw \n‘Swat on\nMeoiun \nLance a.\nCHAPTER \nRUNNING","tokenEstimate":661,"keywords":["using","and","tracking","conditions","many","rules","features","the","game","apply","creatures","you","can","also","fly","when","makes","sense","for","example"]},{"id":"dmg-72","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 2: Running the Game","The Game"],"heading":"The Game","content":"CREATURE\nSIZE\nAND \nSPACE\nA\ncreature's size determines how much space\nit occupies on squares or hexes, as shown\nin the\nCreature\nSize and\nSpace table and the accompanying diagrams.\nIf the miniature you use for a monster takes\nup an amount of space different from what's\nin the table, that's fine, but treat the\nmonster as its official size for all rules.\nFor example, you might use a miniature that\nhas a\nLarge base to represent a\nHuge giant.\n‘That giant takes up less space on the battlefield\nthan size suggests, but itis still\nHuge for the purposes of rules like grappling.\nCREATURE \nSIZE \nAND \nSPACE\nSize \nSpace in\nSquares \nSpace in\nHexes,\nTiny per square per hex\nSmall square\nThex\nMedium square hex\nLarge squares\n(2by hexes\nHuge squares by3) hexes\nGargantuan \n16 squares by hexes or or more  more\nAREAS \nOF\nEFFECT\nAn area of effect must be translated onto\nsquares or hexes to determine which potential targets\nare in the area.\nIf the area has a point of origin, choose\nan intersection of squares or hexes to be\nthe point of origin, then follow its rules\nas normal.\nIf an area of effect covers at least half\na\nsquare or hex, the entire square or hex is\naffected.\nHuse \nGaacanruan,\n\nHave Coven\nCover ON","tokenEstimate":301,"keywords":["the","game","creature","size","and","space","creature's","determines","how","much","occupies","squares","hexes","shown","table","accompanying","diagrams","miniature","you","use"]},{"id":"dmg-73","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 2: Running the Game","Squares and"],"heading":"Squares and","content":"Hexes\nLine oF\nSIGHT\nTo determine whether there is line of sight between\ntwo spaces, pick a corner of one space and trace\nan imaginary line from that corner to any part of\nanother space. If you can trace a line that doesn't\npass through or touch an object or effect that blocks\nvision—such as a stone wall, a thick curtain, or a\ndense cloud of fog—then there is line of sight.\nCover\n‘The accompanying diagrams illustrate cover on\nsquares or hexes. To determine whether a target\nhas cover against an attack or other effect, choose\na corner of the attacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect. Then trace imaginary lines\nfrom that corner to every corner of any one square\nthe target occupies. If one or two ofthose lines are\nblocked by an obstacle (includinga creature), the\ntarget has Half Cover. If three or four of those lines\nare blocked but the attack or effect can still reach\nthe target (such as when the target is behind an arrow lit), the target has Three-Quarters Cover.\nOn hexes, use the same procedure as above, drawing lines between the corners ofthe hexagons. The\ntarget has Half Cover if one, two, or three lines are\nblocked by an obstacle, and Three-Quarters Cover\nif four or more lines are blocked but the attack or\neffect can still reach the target.\nD1AGONAL MOVEMENT\n‘The Player's Handbook presents a simple method for\ncounting movement and measuring range on a grid\nof squares: count every square as 5 feet, even if the\ncreature is moving or counting diagonally. While\nfast in play, this rule breaks the laws of geometry.\nIf you want more accuracy, use the following rule:\nthe first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the\nsecond diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever\nyou're counting diagonally, even if the creature\nmoves straight between different bits of diagonal\nmovement. For example, a character might move 1\nsquare diagonally (5 feet), then 3 squares straight\n(15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10\nfeet) for a total movement of 30 feet.\nTRACKING PosiTION AT LONG RANGE\nIf combat erupts between two groups that are hundreds of feet away from each other, try the following techniques to keep track of who's where:\nNote Paper. List all combatants on a piece of paper, and keep a running tally of each creature's\ndistance from the party's starting point (the\nparty starts at 0 feet). As the characters advance,\nincrease their numbers; as the monsters advance\ntoward the characters, decrease their numbers.\nAdjust the Grid Scale. If you're using a battle grid,\ntake a section ofthat grid and use it to track position, changing the scale so that each square is 30\nfeet.  You don’t need to be precise about creatures’\npositions, just their distance from each other.\nDice as Range Counters. Do away with the grid\nand put miniatures in their relative positions, us~\ning dice next to each miniature to show how far\nthey've traveled. You can use percentile dice (or\nthree di0s, with each die representing a digit in\na three-digit number, if the encounter begins at a\nrange between 100 and 1,000 feet), or use one or\nmore 420s to show how many 5-foot or 10-foot\nsquares the creature has advanced.\n\nNARRATION \nIN \nCOMBAT\nAlthough it’s important that the players\nunderstand what's going on in terms of the\nrules, the game can get dull if everyone\nuses only\n“gamespeak\": \n“That's an to hit,”\n“You hit;\nnow roll damage,”\n“I1\npoints,” and\n“OK,\nnow we're to\nInitiative count\n13.\" \nInstead, use the rules and your knowledge\nof the scene to help your narration.\nIf is barely a hit, but the points of damage\nis a bad wound for the enemy, say:\n“You swing wildly, and the knight brings\nhis, shield up just a second too late.\nYour blade catches him along the jaw, drawing\na\ndeep gash.\nHe recoils, bleeding badly!\nAs the characters fight monsters, you can\nreveal formation to help the players make\ngood choices, as described in the sections\nthat follow.\nLoss or Hir\nPoints\nYou can give players a sense of how well they're\ndoing against a creature by describing, in\nnarrative terms, how hurt the creature is.\nFor example, if the creature is\nBloodied, you might say the creature has\nvisible wounds and appears beaten down. Such\ninformation gives the players a sense of\nprogress and might spur them to press the\nattack.\nOn the other hand, if the characters aren't\ndamaging the creature much, let the players\nknow the creature doesn't look hurt.\nThat might encourage the players to change\ntheir plan,\nABILITIES,

\nCOMBAT\nWhen a monster takes an action in combat,\nthe players need to have some idea what's\ngoing on both in the fictional reality of the\ngame and in terms of the rules of the game.\nThis means that when an enemy with a\nCrossbow takes the\nReady action to cover the area in front of\na door, the players should have a pretty\ngood idea that if their characters move in\nfront of that door, the enemy will shoot\nthem.\nA\nmonster's description in the Monster\nManual, often explains what's happening in\nthe world while the monster is using its\nspecial actions.\nThe\nDescribing Actions table has descriptions\nyou can use to explain what's going on when\na\ncreature takes one of the common actions available to\nall creatures.\nCHAPTER 2 \nDescrisinc \nACTIONS\nAction Description\nDash \n“Dispensing with attacks, your foe hurries\nacross the room.”\nDisengage \n“Careful not to drop its guard, your foe\n‘edges away from you.”\nDodge \n“Your foe watches you closely and tries,\nto parry your attacks.”\nHelp \n“While its ally attacks, your foe darts around, causing\na\ndistraction.”\nMagic \n“Your foe gestures in a deliberate manner and utters an invocation.”\nReady “Your foe seems to be waiting for something,\nready to act.”\nYou can combine those narrative descriptions\nwith game rules:\n“Dispensing with attacks, your foe hurries\nacross the room, taking the\nDash action.”\nMonsTERs \nCasTING \nSPELLS\nIt's important that players can tell when\ntheir characters’ opponents are casting spells,\ngiving the characters the opportunity to\ncast Counterspell or otherwise interfere\nwith the spellcasting.\nWhen a monster casts a spell, check the components\nit’s using and describe its activity appropriately.\nIf the spell has\nVerbal components, the monster might chant, boldly proclaim,\nor hiss the mystic syllables of the spell.\nSomatic components involve the monster moving\nits hands\n(or similar appendages) in graceful patterns,\nshaping them into angular positions, or thrusting\nthem sharply forward.\nFinally, the monster might be holding a\nSpellcasting\nFocus or some other Material component.\nAWARDING \nHEROIC \nINSPIRATION\nAs discussed in the\nPlayer's\nHandbook,\nHeroic\nInspiration is a reward you can give to characters\nwhen their players make the game more fun, ex:\ning, and memorable for everyone at the table.\n‘Any player who makes the whole table erupt\nin laughter, cheers, or howls of surprise\nprobably deserves Heroic\nInspiration.\nYou can also use Heroic\nInspiration to reward roleplaying, immersion\nin the game, and heroism.\nUse it to incentivize the kind of behavior you\nwant to see in your game, such as acting\nin character, taking risks, thinking strategically,\ncooperating well, or embracing the tropes\nof a particular genre.\nMake sure your use of Heroic\nInspiration is aligned with the expectations\nyou set out at the start of your game\n(see\n“Ensuring Fun for All” in chapter\n1).\nNee \nEe\n\nSome monsters have the special ability to ignor\nsome or all ofa spell’s  normal components, which\nmight prevent characters from recognizing what\nthe monster is doing:  Similarly,  when monsters use\nmagical abilities  that don’t involve casting  spells,\nmake sure it's clear to the players that the monster\nis drawing on its unique magical abilities, not casting a spell their characters could counter.","tokenEstimate":932,"keywords":["and","weaknesses","share","information","with","the","players","about","characteristics","creatures","they","fight","those","become","apparent","for","example","wizard","casts","fire"]},{"id":"dmg-75","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon

For example, a  Common magic\nitem might confer the benefit of a level I spell once\nper day (or just once if it's consumable). A Rare,\nVery Rare, or Legendary magic item might allow its,\npossessor to cast a lower-level spell more frequently.\n‘Maximum Bonus. If an item delivers a static bonus\nto AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks,\nthis column suggests an appropriate bonus based on\nthe item’s rarity.\nATTUNEMENT\nDecide whether the item requires a character to be\nattuned to it to use its properties. Consider the following\nguidelines.\nLimit Sharing. If having all the characters in a\nparty pass an item around to gain its lasting benefits would be disruptive, the item should require\nAttunement.\nLimit Stacking. If the item grants a bonus that\nother items also grant, it's a good idea to require\nAttunement so characters don't try to collect too\nmany of those items.\n\nCREATING A \nSPELL\nWhen creating a new spell, use existing ones as examples. \nHere are some things to consider:\nName. The spell must have a unique name.\nBalance.\nIf the spell is so good that a caster would\nwant to use it all the time, it’s probably too power\nful for its level\nIdentity.\nMake sure the spell fits with the identity\nof those who can cast it.\nSorcerers and Wizards don't typically cast healing spells, for example.\nSpell \nDuration,\nRange, and\nArea.\nA\nlonger duration, greater range, or larger\narea can make up for a lesser effect, depending on the spell.\nUtility. Avoid spells that have very limited use, such\nas one that works only against Oozes,\nFew characters will bother to learn or prepare such\na\nspell.\nSPELL DAMAGE_\nFor any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage table to determine approximately how much\ndamage is appropriate given the spell's level.\nThe table assumes the spell deals half as much damage on\na successful saving throw ora missed attack. If your\nspell doesn't deal damage on a successful save, you\ncan increase the damage by 25 percent.\nYou can use different damage dice than the\nones in the table if the average damage is\nabout the same.\nFor example, you could change a cantrip’s damage\nfrom 1410 (average 5.5) to 2d4 (average 5), reducing\nthe maximum damage and making an average\nresult more likely.\n‘Spevt DAMAGE\nSpell\nLevel \nOne\nTarget \nMultiple Targets\nCantrip  ido 1d6\n2d10 \n2d6\n2  3d10  3d6\n3  5410  6d6\n4 6d10  746\n5  7410  8d6\n6  todio  m1d6\n7  dio  12d6\n8  y2di0  13d6\n9  1sd10  16d6","tokenEstimate":767,"keywords":["power","level","you","make","item","that","lets","character","kill","whatever","they","hit","with","will","likely","unbalance","your","game","the","other"]},{"id":"dmg-107","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 2: Running the Game","Healing Spells"],"heading":"Healing Spells","content":"You can also use the Spell Damage table to determine how many Hit Points a healing spell restores.\nA cantrip shouldn't provide healing.","tokenEstimate":34,"keywords":["healing","spells","you","can","also","use","the","spell","damage","table","determine","how","many","hit","points","restores","cantrip","shouldn't","provide"]},{"id":"dmg-108","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 2: Running the Game","Curses and"],"heading":"Curses and","content":"MaAcIcAL \nCONTAGIONS\n‘A curse is a magical burden that lasts for a specified\ntime or until it is ended by some means.\nA\nmagical contagion is an adverse effect of magical origin that\nis contagious by definition.\nThe following sections discuss curses and\nmagical contagions in detail.\nCursEs\nA curse typically takes one of the forms detailed\nbelow.\nBrstow Curse\nThe simplest curses are created by the\nBestow\nCurse spell.

Gods can reliably predict the future, at\nleast in the short term (hence their ability to answer\nspells such as Augury and Divination).

A\nfortification can be anything from a fortress in the\nheart of a city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While the fortification is for the characters\nto govern as they see fit, the land on which it sits\nremains the property of the crown or local ruler.\nShould the characters prove disloyal or unworthy\nof the gift, they can be asked or forced to relinquish\ncustody of the fortification. In that respect, the fortification is different from the characters’ Bastions\n(described in chapter 8). However, you can also use\nthe gift of a fortification as a pretext for the characters acquiring their Bastions.\nThe individual bequeathing the fortification might\noffer to pay its maintenance costs for one or more\nmonths, after which the characters inherit that responsibility.

Moreover, carrying such a recommendation\non one’s person establish a baseline of trust with\nlocal authorities.\n\nA letter of recommendation is worth only as much\nas the reputation of the person who wrote it and offers no benefit where its writer holds no sway.\nMEDALS\nAlthough they are often fashioned from gold and\nother precious materials, medals have an even\ngreater symbolic value to those who award and receive them. Medals are typically awarded by political figures for acts of heroism, and wearing a medal\nis usually enough to earn the respect of those who\nunderstand its significance.\nDifferent acts of heroism can warrant different\nkinds of medals. The king of Breland (in the Eberron setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor\n(shaped like a shield and made of ruby and elec\ntrum) to adventurers for defending Brelish citizens.\nThe Golden Bear of Breland (a medal made of gold\nand shaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems\nfor eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who\nprove their allegiance to the Brelish Crown.\n‘Amedal doesn't offer a specific in-game benefit\nto one who wears it, but it can affect dealings with\nNPCs.

For example, a character might be\nawarded the title Earl of Stormriver or Countess of\nDun Fjord, along with a parcel of land that includes\na settlement or region ofthe same name.

Contact poison can be smeared on an\nobject and remains potent until it is touched or\nwashed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.\nIngested. A creature must swallow an entire dose\nof ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose\ncan be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such\nas allowing Advantage on the saving throw or\ndealing only half as much damage on a failed save.\nInhaled. Poisonous powders and gases take effect\nwhen inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing\nthe gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its\neffect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately\nafterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective\nagainst inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.\nInjury. Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus\nAction to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or\nimilar object. The poison remains  potent until\ndelivered through a wound or washed off.

Comic series and serialized TV dramas\nare particularly good comparisons because of the\nway individual adventures are limited in scope but\nblend together (to some degree) to create a larger\nnarrative. If an adventure is a single episode or season of a series, a campaign is the series as a whole.\nBut while it’s worthwhile to compare an adventure to these other forms of storytelling, remember\nshat an adventure isn't a complete story until you\nstay it. Your players are coauthors of the story with\n‘you, and the events of the story shouldn't be predetermined; the actions ofthe players’ characters\nSave to matter. For example, if a major villain shows\n=p before the end of the adventure, the adventure\nsSould allow for the possibility that the heroes\ndefeat that villain. Otherwise, players can feel as if\nthey've been railroaded—set onto a course that has\nonly one destination or outcome, no matter how\nhard they try to change it.\nYou might find it helpful to think about an adventure not as a narrative that arcs from beginning\nto end with little chance for deviation, but more in\nterms of situations that you are presenting to the\ncharacters. The adventure unfolds organically from\nthe players’ responses to the situations you present.\nADVENTURE \nPREMISE\nOne way to start brainstorming an adventure is to\nimagine a situation that might pique the characters’\ninterest. For some D&D players, a rumor ofa dungeon filled with treasure is enough of a premise to\nlaunch an adventure. A brewing warbetween two\nsmall nations, the death of a leader and the accession of a new one, a migration of dangerous monsters, the appearance of a comet, and the opening\nofa portal to another plane of existence are other\nsituations that could lead to adventure.\nA simple premise might also boil down to “a magic\nitem that the characters want is hidden away in a\ndungeon.” Browsing the magic items in chapter 7\ncan inspire you to create a simple adventure seed.\nUSING PusLisHeD ADVENTURES\nA published adventure includes a pregenerated\nscenario with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and\ntreasures you need to run it. This allows you to\nfocus your preparation time on plot develop-\n‘ments that arise from the characters’ actions.\nYou can adjust a published adventure so it\nbetter suits your campaign and appeals to your\nplayers. For example, you can replace the villain\nof an adventure with one the players have already\nencountered in your campaign, or add details\nfrom your campaign setting so the adventure\ninvolves your players’ characters in ways that the\nadventure’s designer never could have imagined.\nPublished adventures also provide inspiration\nfor your own adventures. You can even take a part\nof an adventure and incorporate it into a different one. For example, you might use a map ofa\ntemple but repopulate it with monsters of your\nchoice, or you might use a chase sequence as a\nmodel for a pursuit scene in your campaign.\n\nGuibe \nRAits\nAND \nRAILROADS\nPlayers need to feel like they're in control of\ntheir characters, the choices they make matter, and\nwhat they do has some effect on the outcome of\nthe adventure and on the game world. Keep that.\nin mind as you're planning adventures. If your\nadventure relies on certain events, plan for multiple ways they might come about, or be prepared\nfor clever players to prevent those events\nfrom happening as you expect,\nOtherwise, your players might end up feeling railroaded,\nOn the flip side, players sometimes willfully\ndisregard the adventure hooks you put in\nfront of them and go entirely off the rails. See “Respect\nfor the DM” in chapter 1 and “Draw In the Players” later in this chapter for advice about dealing\nwith this situation.\n‘One way to give players impactful choices is to\nkeep multiple adventure possibilities available to\nthem at the same time.\nIf the characters have two or three things\nthey can investigate or pursue, they have a meaningful choice. And if whatever\nthreads they don't investigate turn into\nbigger problems, you've clearly demonstrated that their\ndecisions matter.\nADVENTURE \nCONFLICT\nA premise can be a good starting point, but before\nyou can turn it into an adventure, it needs\na\nconflict\n‘worthy of the heroes’ attention.\nThe conflict might be driven by a single villain or monster, a  villain\nwith lackeys, an assortment of monsters,\nor an evil organization.\nBut it need not involve the forces of evil it could be a rivalry or disagreement between\ntwo families, organizations, or nations; a looming\nnatural\n(or magical) disaster;\nor even conflict within the adventuring party about\nhow to pursue the characters’ goals.\nGiven a premise of a dungeon filled with\ntreasure, what conflict awaits the characters\nwhen they enter the dungeon? That might be as simple as “ho:\nmonsters want to eat the characters” or\n“two rival factions of monsters inhabit the dungeon.”\nIt might also involve a rival or a villain\nhoping to plunder the dungeon first, a rumbling volcano threatening to\nerupt and bury the dungeon, or two rival\nfamilies claiming ownership of the treasure\nleft behind in the dungeon by their ancestors,\nIf you're stuck, browse through the\nMonster\nManual until you find a monster that inspires you.\n\nADVENTURE \nSITUATIONS \nBY \nLEVEL\nUse the tables in this section to inspire adventure\nideas for characters

An adventure map\ncan take many forms—from a detailed dungeon\nmap that shows the dimensions and contents of every room to a rough outline of how one encounter\nmight lead to another, depending on the route the\ncharacters choose.

Predators need prey, and intelligent creatures search for lairs offering the best\ncombination of air, food, water, and security. Keep\nthese factors in mind when designing an adventure\nlocation. If the site has an internal logic, adventurers can use their understanding of that logic to\nmake informed decisions.\nFor example, characters who find a pool of fresh\nwater in a dungeon might infer that many of the\ncreatures inhabiting the dungeon come to that spot\nto drink. The adventurers might set an ambush at\nthe pool. Likewise, closed or locked doors can restrict the movement of some creatures. A dungeon\ninfested with carrion crawlers or stirges would need\nopen passages so that these creatures can move\nabout to find food.","tokenEstimate":561,"keywords":["adventure","maps","location","almost","always","benefits","from","map","and","the","more","thoughtfully","constructed","fun","players","are","likely","have","their","characters"]},{"id":"dmg-188","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 4: Creating Adventures","Adventure Inhabitants"],"heading":"Adventure Inhabitants","content":"The monsters in any adventure location are more\nthan a collection of random creatures that happen\nto live near one another.

It’s not\nalways easy to mimic that structure in an adventure\nwhere the players control their characters’ actions,\nbut you can use the encounters you plan to build\ntension toward a climax.\nEach encounter in an adventure is an opportunity\nto make the characters’ situation more complex\nand urgent, with more significant consequences.\nSuccessive encounters raise the tension in an adventure\nnaturally, as characters spend their limited\nresources. Variety also contributes to a sense of escalating tension. Build variety into your encounters\nin three ways:\nVary Encounter Type. Use a mix of social interaction, exploration, and combat encounters. Different types of encounters provide different amounts\n\nof tension\n(generally, combat encounters offer the most), but they also feel very different and can\nhave drastically different stakes.\nVary Encounter Difficulty. Include encounters\nthat offer low, moderate, and high difficulty. A\nmix of low- and moderate-difficulty encounters\nearly in the adventure can lead to a climactic\nhigh-difficulty fight, perhaps against the adventure's primary villain or another threat.\nVary Threats. Build encounters using different\nthreats. If the characters are delving into a kuotoa\ntemple and therefore expect many encounters\nto include various kuo-toa, look for opportunities\nto include different monsters that might serve as\nguards, pets, or allies to the kuo-toa, Include a\nvariety of hazards, environmental dangers,\nand traps in exploration encounters, and use NPCs\nwith different personalities and different goals in\nsocial interaction encounters.\nUrcENcy AND Rests\nWhile successive encounters increase tension, taking a Short Rest relaxes the tension somewhat, as\ncharacters have a chance to replenish some\nof their resources.\nIn many adventures, though, the characters and their players have a sense that they need\nto act quickly to deal with the situation presented\nby the adventure. This creates tension between\nthe need to rest and the sense that things are getting\nworse while the characters are resting.\n‘You can influence the pace and tension of your\nadventure by determining where and when the\ncharacters can rest. If the characters are exploring a\nvast dungeon, consider scattering a few small rooms\nwith only one door, where the characters can bar\nthe door and reasonably expect to spend an hour or\neven a night resting in safety. On the flip side, cautious\ncharacters might try to take a\nShort\nRest between every encounter, never really straining their\nresources. It’s OK to interrupt those rests once in a\nwhile to maintain a sense of tension or to heighten\nthe urgency, making it clear that even an hour\nspent resting could jeopardize their chances\nof success.\nEasing Up. It is possible to dial up the urgency to\nthe point that the players feel they don’t have time\nto investigate the interesting details they encounter\nin the world. When this happens, consider using a\nhelpful\nNPC\nto take some of the pressure off.\nA\nwise elder might advise them that the situation\nis not as urgent as they fear, a whimsical Fey being might use\n‘magical mischief to force them to slow down, or a\nKindly Celestial could tell them they're taking the\nconcerns of the mortal world just a bit too\nseriously.\n\nRANDOM \nENCOUNTERS\nRandom encounters are randomly determined\nencounters that don't occur in a fixed location.\nThe options are often presented in a table.\nWhen a random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult\nthe table to determine what the party encounters.\nSample random encounter tables appear in\nthe adventure examples later in this chapter.\nSimilar tables appear in many published adventures\nand rulebooks, and you can easily create your own by\nfollowing these examples,\nHandled well, random encounters can serve\na\nvariety of useful purposes.\nCreate Urgency. Wandering monsters encourage\ncharacters to keep moving and to find a safe place\nto rest.\nSometimes you can create a sense of danger\nand urgency by rolling dice behind your\nDM\nscreen, even without an actual encounter!\nDrain Character Resources. By draining the party's\nHit Points and spell slots, leaving the adventurers\nfeeling underpowered and vulnerable, random encounters can build tension in an adventure.\nEstablish\nAtmosphere. Thematic links among monsters appearing in random encounters create a tone\nand an atmosphere that define the environment the\ncharacters are exploring. For example, an encounter table filled\nwith bats, wraiths, giant spiders, and zombies creates a sense of horror and suggests the\npossibility of even more terrifying foes.\nProvide\nAssistance. \nSome random encounters can benefit the characters instead of hindering or harming them, Helpful creatures might give the characters useful information or assistance.\nReinforce\nCampaign\nThemes. \nRandom encounters can remind the players of the major themes and\nconflicts in your campaign. For example, ifa war\nbetween two nations is a major conflict in\nyour campaign, you might design random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present threat of that conflict, including encounters with bedraggled troops\nreturning from battle, refugees fleeing invaders,\nlone messengers riding for the front lines, enemy\nwar parties, and so on\nA Life of Its Own. Sometimes a random encounter\nthat starts off incidental can become important to\nthe story. A random encounter with a wandering\nogre might end with the ogre offering to help the\ncharacters get where they need to go, or the ogre\nmight have something in a nearby den that is  significant to the adventure story—a prisoner, a stolen\nm, or important information. Or the players\night find the ogre's personality delightful, prompting you to make the ogre a more important part of\nthe story.\nCHAPTER \n4| CREATING ADVENTURES  119\n\nBrinG IT TO AN END\nThe climactic ending of an adventure fulfills\nthe promise of all that came before. The best climax\nis one the players see coming, so if a dragon\nis the mastermind behind all the nefarious\nactivity happening in an adventure, having the dragon's minions mention the nature of their boss sets up the\ncoming climactic encounter.\nAlthough the climax must hinge on the successes\nand failures of the characters up to that\nmoment, the Adventure Climax table can provide suggestions\nto help you shape the end of your adventure.","tokenEstimate":1609,"keywords":["encounter","pace","and","tension","good","story","hooks","you","with","interesting","introduction","builds","steadily","throughout","the","then","reaches","climactic","conclusion","not"]},{"id":"dmg-199","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 4: Creating Adventures","Adventure Climax"],"heading":"Adventure Climax","content":"1410.

A perceptible region of a plane might\nseem quite small on one visit, and on another\ntrip can stretch on to what seems like infinity.\nAdventurers could take a guided tour of the\nNine\nHells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day—if\nthe powers of the\nNine\nHells desire it.\nOr it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek\nacross a single layer.\nLayers OF THE OUTER PLANES\nMost\nOuter\nPlanes include a number of distinct realms.\nThese environments are often imagined as a\nstack of related parts of the same plane, so travelers\nrefer to them as layers.\nFor example,\nMount\nCelestia resembles a sacred mountain with\nseven great plateaus along its ascent, the Nine Hells is like a pit\nwhere the River Styx plunges down through nine\ntiers, and the\nAbyss has a seemingly endless number of layers.\nLike the planes themselves, the description of\nlayers is highly metaphorical and subject\nto varying interpretations.\nThe plane of\nCarceri, for example, has been described as a long series of spherical\nworlds arranged like beads on a string, with each\nsphere consisting of six nested spheres—the\nlayers of the plane.\nThis fanciful description is but one attempt to make sense of the distorted geography of\na\nplace that isn't even a place in the ordinary sense\nof the word, but an alternate state of reality.\nMost portals from elsewhere reach the first\nlayer of a multilayered plane.\nThis layer is depicted as the top or bottom\nlayer, depending on the plane.\nAs the arrival point for most visitors, the\nfirst layer funetions like an antechamber for that plane.","tokenEstimate":1582,"keywords":["elemental","plane","fire","for","example","suffused","with","the","fundamental","nature","energy","passion","transformation","and","destruction","even","objects","solid","brass","basalt"]},{"id":"dmg-208","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 6: Cosmology","Alignment and the Outer"],"heading":"Alignment and the Outer","content":"PLANES\n‘The\nOuter\nPlanes are realms of thought and morality\nmore than merely physical reality, and they can\naffect visitors on a deeply personal level\nas well as a physical one.\nAt your discretion, a creature that spends\na\nlong time on an Outer\nPlane that is not its home plan can begin\nto take on aspects of that plane's ethos.\nVisitors to the\nUpper\nPlanes might feel strange urges to perform deeds\nof kindness or compassion, while visitors to the\nLower\nPlanes might find themselves\n\ndrawn to acts of cruelty or betrayal.\nThose who spend time on Mechanus and other\nlawful planes might feel their ties of loyalty to each other growing\nstronger, while those who visit\nLimbo and other chaotic planes might become\ntemporarily more independent or self-absorbed.

Often, though, a\nportal presents an adventure in itselE.\nFirst, the adventurers must find a portal that leads\nwhere they want to go.\nMost portals exist in distant locations,\nand a portal's location often has thematic\nsimilarities to the plane it leads to.\nFor example, a portal to\nMount\nCelestia might be located on a mountain peak.\n\nSecond, portals often have guardians charged\nwith ensuring that certain creatures don’t pass\nthrough. A portal’s guardian is typically a powerful\nmagical creature, such as a djinni, a sphinx, a titan,\nor an inhabitant of the portal’s destination plane.\nFinally, most portals aren't open all the time, but\nopen only in particular situations or when a certain\nrequirement is met. A portal can have any require-\n‘ment, but the following are the most common:\nCommand. The portal functions only if a particular\n‘command is given. A command is usually a word\nthat can be invoked in any language (including a\nsigned language). Sometimes the command must\nbe given as a character passes through the portal,\n(which is otherwise a mundane doorway, window,\nor similar opening). Other portals open when the\n‘command is given within 15 feet of themselves,\nand they remain open for Id12 minutes.\nKey Item. The portal functions if the traveler carries\na\nparticular object;\nthe item acts much like a key toa door. This item can be a common object\nora particular one created for that portal. The\ncity of\nSigil above the\nOutlands is known as the\nCity of Doors because it features an overwhelming number of such item-keyed portals.\nRandom. The portal functions for a random period,\nthen shuts down for a similarly random duration.\nTypically, such a portal allows 1d6 + 6 travelers to\npass through, then closes for 1d6 days.\nSituation. The portal functions only if  a  particular\ncondition is met. A situation-keyed portal might\nopen on a clear night, when it rains, or when a\ncertain spell is cast in its vicinity.\nTime.\nThe portal functions only at particular times\non the Material Plane: during a full moon, during\nthe spring equinox or winter solstice, or when the\nstars are in certain positions. Once it opens, such\na portal remains open for a limited time, such as\nfor 3 days following the full moon, for 1 hour, or\nfor 10 minutes.\nLearning and meeting a portal’s requirements can\ndraw characters into further adventures as they\nchase down a key item, scour old libraries for commands, or consult sages to find the right time to\nvisit the portal.\nSPELLS\nA number of spells allow direct or indirect access\nto different planes of existence. Gate and Plane Shift\ncan directly transport adventurers to any other\nplane, with different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane.\nAnd Astral Projection lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and from\nthere travel to the\nOuter\nPlanes.\n‘TRAVELING THE OUTER PLANES\nDescribed in the sections that follow are four planar\nfeatures that connect multiple Outer Planes:\n+  The Infinite Staircase\n+  The River Oceanus\n+  The River Styx\nYggdrasil, the\nWorld\nTree\nOther planar crossings might exist in your campaign, or it might be possible to walk (or journey\naboard a wondrous train or similar vehicle)\nfrom one plane to another in your cosmology.","tokenEstimate":1490,"keywords":["alignment","and","the","outer","planes","are","realms","thought","morality","more","than","merely","physical","reality","they","can","affect","visitors","deeply","personal"]},{"id":"dmg-209","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 6: Cosmology","Infinite Staircase"],"heading":"Infinite Staircase","content":"‘The\nInfinite\nStaircase is an extradimensional staircase that connects the planes.

Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells, is a\nlabyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer\nmountains rich with iron ore.\nIron roads span and wend through the canyons,\nwatched over by the garrisons of iron fortresses\nperched atop jagged pinnacles.\nThe second layer takes its name from its\ncurrent lord,\nDispater.\nA\nmanipulator and deceiver, the archduke is\ndevilishly handsome, bearing only small horns,\na \ntail, and a cloven left hoof to distinguish\nhim from a human.\nHis crimson throne stands in the heart of\nthe\nIron City of\nDis, a hideous metropolis.\nPlanar travelers come here to conspire with\ndevils and to close deals with night hags,\nrakshasas, incubi, succubi, and other\nFiends.\nContracts signed on his layer contain special\nprovisions that allow\nDispater to collect a cut of the deal.\nDispater is one of\nAsmodeus's most loyal and resourceful vassals,\nand few beings in the multiverse can outwit him.\nHe is more obsessed than most devils with\nstriking deals with mortals in exchange for their\nsouls, and his emissaries work tirelessly\nto foster evil schemes on the Material\nPlane.\nMinauros.\nThe third layer of the\nNine\nHells is a stench-ridden bog.\nAcidic rain spills from the layer's brown\nskies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid\nsurface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath\nthe murk to engulf careless wanderers.\nCyclopean cities of ornately carved stone\nrise up from the bog, including the great\ncity of Minauros, for which the layer is\nnamed.\nThe slimy walls of the city rise hundreds\nof feet, protecting the flooded halls that\nare the lair of\nMammon, the archduke of\nMinauros.\nMammon resembles a massive serpent with the\nupper torso and head of a hairless, horned\nhumanoid.\nMammon’s greed is legendary, and he is one\nof the few archdevils who will trade favors\nfor gold instead of souls.\nHis lair is piled high with treasures left\nbehind by those who tried—and failed—to best\nhim in a deal.\nPhlegethos. Phlegethos, the fourth layer,\nisa fiery landscape whose seas of molten\nmagma brew hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and\nvolcanic ash.\nWithin the fire-filled caldera of\nPhlegethos's largest volcano rises\nAbriymoch, a fortress city made of obsidian\nand dark glass.\nWith rivers of molten lava pouring down its\nouter walls, the city resembles the sculpted centerpiece\nof a gigantic, hellish fountain.\nAbriymoch is the seat of power for the two\narchdevils who rule Phlegethos in tandem:\nBelial and\nFierna,\nBelial's daughter. Both are handsome devils\nwho resemble tieflings, with red skin and\nsmall horns. Belial exudes civility, even\nas his words carry\n\nan undercurrent of threat. His daughter is said to\nhave the wickedest heart in the Nine Hells. The alfiance of Belial and Fierna is unbreakable, for both\ne aware that their mutual survival hinges on it\nStygia. The fifth layer of the Nine Hellsis a freez~\ning realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A\n‘ozen sea surrounds the layer, and its gloomy\nsky ackles with lightning.\nArchduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and\n's  now encased deep in the ice of\nStygia as punishint. He rules this layer all the same, communicating\ntelepathically with his followers and servants,\nh in the Nine Hells and on the Material Plan.\nStygia is also home to its previous ruler, the s\nentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed by\nsmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus to rezain his rule.  Geryon’s fall from grace has spurred\nmuch debate within the infernal courts. No one is\ntain whether Asmodeus had some secret cause to\ndismiss the archdevil or whether he is testing Geryn’s allegiance for some greater purpose\nMalbolge. Malbolge, the sixth layer,  has outlasted\nmany rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countss and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of\nor and was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of\npique, while her predecessor, Moloch, still  linger\nsomewhere on the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to\nAN ETERNAL BaTTLErieLO in THe BLooo Waa.\nee regain Asmodeus's favor. Malbolge is a seemingly\nendless slope, like the sides of an impossibly huge\nmountain. Parts of the layer break off from time\nto time, creating deadly, booming avalanches. The\ninhabitants of Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses\nand great caves carved into the mountainside.\nMalbolge's current ruler isAsmodeus's daughter,\nGlasya. Her cruelty and love of wicked  schemes\nval those of her father. The citadel that serves as her\ndomicile on the slopes of Malbolge, called Osseia, is\nsupported by cracked pillars and buttresses that are\nsturdy yet seem on the verge of collapse. Beneath\nthe palace is a labyrinth lined with cells and torture\nchambers, where Glasya confines and torments\nthose who displease her.\nMaladomini. The seventh layer, Maladomini, is\nruin-covered wasteland. Dead cities form a des\nolate urban landscape, and between them are\nempty quarries,  crumbling  roads,  slag heaps, the\nhollow shells of empty fortresses, and swarms of\nhungry flies.\nThe archduke of Maladomini is  Baalzebul, the\nLord of Flies.  He is a tall, powerful devil with the\ncompound eyes of a fly. The archduke has long conspired to usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every\nturn. Asmodeus laid a curse on him that causes any\ndeal made with him to lead to calamity. Asmodeus\nCHAPTER6| COSMOLOGY  203\n\noccasionally shows Baalzebul favor for reasons no\nother archduke can fathom, though some suspect\nthat\nAsmodeus still respects the worthiness of\nthis adversary.\nCania, Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells,\nis a frozen hellscape whose ice storms can\ntear flesh from bone.\nCities embedded in the ice provide shelter for guests and prisoners of  Cania’s ruler, the\nbrilliant and conniving archdevil\nMephistopheles.\nMephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel\nof\nMephistar, where he plots to seize the throne of the\nNine Hells and conquer all the planes, He is Asmodeus's greatest\nenemy and ally, and the archduke of\nNessus appears to trust\nMephi \n»pheles's counsel.\nMephistopheles knows he can't depose\nAsmodeus until his adversary makes a fatal\nmiscalculation, and so both wait to discover\nwhat circumstances might turn them against\neach other.\nMephistopheles is also a godfather of sorts to\nGlasya, further complicating the relationship\nbetween \nMephistophel and Asmodeus.\nMephistopheles is a tall, striking devil\nwith imsive horns and a cool demeanor.

ofa previous owner, or self-aware thanks to\nthe magic used to create it. A sentient item might be\na cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn\nin the side.\nMost sentient items are weapons, but other kinds\nofitems can manifest sentience. Single-use items\nsuch as potions and scrolls are never sentient.\n‘The DM controls sentient magic items and their\nactivated properties. A bearer who maintains a\ngood relationship with the item can access those\nproperties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict\ncan ensue\n(see\n“Conflict” below).\nSENTIENT Macic Irem Traits\n‘When you make a sentient magic item, you create\nthe item’s persona much as you would create an\nNPC (as described in the “Nonplayer Characters”\nsection of chapter 3), with these exceptions.\nAbilities. A sentient magic item has Intelligence,\nWisdom, and Charisma scores. Choose the item's\nabilities, or determine them randomly as follows:\nroll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and\ntotaling the rest.\nAlignment. A sentient magiciitem has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise, pick an alignment or roll on the\nSentient Item's Alignment table.\nCommunication. A sentient item communicates\nby sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts\ntelepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose\nhow it communicates or roll on the Sentient Item's\nCommunication table.\nSenses. A sentient item can perceive  its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its\nsenses or roll on the Sentient Item’s Senses table,\nSpecial Purpose. You can give a sentient item an\nobjective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion ofall\nelse. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns\nwith that special purpose, the item remains cooperative, Deviating from this course might cause\nconflict between the wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can pick a special purpose or roll\non the Sentient Item's Special Purpose table.\nSENTIENT ITEM’S ALIGNMENT\n14100. \nAlignment  14100 Alignment\n01-15 LawfulGood  74-85 Chaotic Neutral\n16-35 NeutralGood  86-89 Lawful Evil\n36-50 ChaoticGood  90-96 Neutral Evil\n51-63 Lawful Neutral 97-00 Chaotic Evil\n64-73 Neutral\nCHAPTER\nSENTIENT ITEM’s COMMUNICATION\n1410 Communication\n1-6 The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or\nwielding it.\n7-9 The item speaks one or more languages.\n10 The item speaks one or more languages.

It can communicate through\nvisions or dreams when the wielder is either in a\ntrance or asleep.\nPersonality. A Moonblade has a personality similar\nto that of its creator.

When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together\nand forged five Orbs of Dragonkind to help defeat\nthe dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five\ntowers, and there they were used to speed the war\ntoward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs\nto lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons\nwith powerful magi\nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages,\nthe orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and\nonly three are thought to survive.

Melchis hires a ship to carry the party\nto the Amedio Jungle. Use the map to determine\nhow long the sea voyage takes, depending on where\nthe adventurers begin the trip and figuring that\nthe ship covers about 1% hexes per day. Near the\nend ofthe trip, as the ship crosses Jeklea Bay, it’s\nattacked by a group of Hostile sahuagin, including\ntwo Sahuagin Priests, six Sahuagin Warriors, and\na Water Elemental. (Assume the ship's crew stays\nout of the way of these terrifying monsters and lets\nthe characters and Melchis deal with this threat.)\nStage 1 ends when Melchis and the characters row a\nlaunch ashore.\nStage 2.

They are Indifferent; they live in\nthe jungle and aren't used to seeing other\npeople.\n20 Four Minotaurs of Baphomet prow! the jungle looking for Humanoids they can capture\nand bring back to the temple.\nStage 5. Once the characters reach the edge of\nthe lake, Melchis leads them southwest along the\nshore until they find the ruin. This stage covers 90\nmiles through coastal terrain. The second day of\nthe journey, heavy rain obscures vision and creates\nquicksand pits (see “Environmental Effects” and\n“Hazards” in chapter 3). The front rank of the party\nmight fall into a quicksand pit while two Giant\nCrocodiles attack at the same time. The rest of the\njourney passes without incident.\nThe Ruins. For the ruins, use the western half of,\nthe ground floor of the Dungeon Hideout map in appendix B, and ignore the stairs leading to the lower\nlevels. Dwelling in the ruins are six Minotaurs of\nBaphomet who are Hostile to all intruders. They\nare spread out around the ruins but come quickly\nwhen they hear combat.\nThe Artifact. The Horns of the Beast—a jagged\ncrown made from the horns of demons and wild animals—rests on a pedestal in the northwest corner\nof the ruins. Melchis immediately attempts to seize\nthe Artifact and place it on his head. If he does, he\nis transformed into a Hezrou and tries to kill the\ncharacters. A character who dons the Artifact is\ncursed with Demonic Possession (see “Curses and\nMagical Contagions’ in chapter 3). The Artifact\ncan't be removed from the character's head until\na Remove Curse spell is cast on the character. If the\ncharacters defeat Melchis and search him, they find\na Bag of Holding containing twelve 5-pound gold\ntrade bars (worth 250 GP each) and a Spell Scroll\nof Teleportation Circle.

You can learn about your\nplayers’ preferences in two ways:\nDirect\nInput.\nAsk your players what they want to do in a\ncampaign.\nRegularly inquire about how they think the\ncampaign is going, what they'd like to experience\nmore of, and what elements they'd like to\nexplore further.\nAfter a session concludes and between sessions\nare great times to ask players for thoughts\nabout the campaign.\nIndirect\nInput.\nThe choices a player makes, starting at character\ncreation, can indicate what they want to\nsee in the game.\nFor example, a\nRogue player likely wants opportunities for\nsubtlety or skulduggery, while a\nBarbarian player likely craves combat.\nTake note of what encounters players are\nenthusiastic about, and seek ways to help\nthe players’ characters shine.\nCHARACTER \nARCS\nLike most protagonists in film and literature,\nD&D\nadventurers face challenges and change through\nthe experience of overcoming them.\nBy incorporating each character's motivations\ninto your adventures and setting higher stakes\nthrough play, you'll help characters grow\nin exciting ways.\nYou can use the\nDM's\nCharacter Tracker sheet to keep track of\nkey information about each character.\nSee\n“Getting\nPlayers\nInvested” in this chapter for more ideas.\nCharacter\nMotivations.\nFor each character, think about what motivates\nthem to adventure.\nMotivations generally fall into the following\ncategories:\nGoal.\nA\ncharacter's goal is a short-term reason for\nthe character to adventure,\nAt the start of a campaign, this might be\na desire for treasure, a thirst for excitement,\nor some need from a character's backstory.\nAs characters continue to adventure, they'll\nfind different goals to pursue, such as finding\na\nlost relic, honoring an ancestor, avenging\na\nfallen mentor, or defeating a villain.\nAmbition.\nA\ncharacter’s ambition is a broad, personal\naspiration the character hopes to achieve\nthrough a lifetime of adventuring.\nA\ncharacter might dream of becoming a legendary\nknight or bringing peace to their homeland. Ambitions\nmight be unrelated to the character's current\ngoal.\nQuirks and\nWhims.\nQuirks and whims are a character's preferences, impulses, or\nother traits.\nThey often emerge during play, such as a character's\ntendency to one-up a rude innkeeper or their\noft-expressed fondness for displacer beast\nfur.\nPlayers often reveal their characters’ motivations\nthrough play.\nIf you're uncertain or a character's motivations\nseem to have changed, it’s\nOK\nto ask players for clarification,\nFamily, Friends, and\nFoes.\nA\ncharacter's origin\n(species and background) implies some amount\nof backstory, suggesting the character's family\nand what the character did before becoming an\nCHAPTER\nCREATING CAMPAzONS  Rs\n\nal\nCHARACTER’S NAME:\n(,  _DM’S CHARACTER TRACKER ©\nPLAYER’S NAME:\nOAcTING  © EXPLORING","tokenEstimate":849,"keywords":["campaign","characters","the","are","focus","every","adventure","and","their","players","your","partners","developing","epic","journeys","working","with","understand","what","excites"]},{"id":"dmg-531","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 7: Treasure","Notes on Player Expectations"],"heading":"Notes on Player Expectations","content":"CLASS,\n|  BACKGROUND\ne |  \\  GOALS AND AMBITIONS\nQUIRKS","tokenEstimate":14,"keywords":["notes","player","expectations","class","background","goals","and","ambitions","quirks"]},{"id":"dmg-532","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 7: Treasure","Magic  Items"],"heading":"Magic  Items","content":"OFIGHTING e) INSTIGATING\nO optimizing © PROBLEM-SOLVING © SOCIALIZING O STORYTELLING\nSUBCLASS\nSPECIES\nI\nli \nPLAYER \nMOTIVATION","tokenEstimate":32,"keywords":["magic","items","ofighting","instigating","optimizing","problem-solving","socializing","storytelling","subclass","species","player","motivation"]},{"id":"dmg-533","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 7: Treasure","Ly, Friends, and Foes"],"heading":"Ly, Friends, and Foes","content":"adventurer.\nTake note of specific background characters—friends, foes, family members, and others—\nwho might appear in the campaign.\nShould these background characters become\nimportant to the campaign, work with the player to\ndevelop them in detail. Revealing a character's lost\nsibling or childhood rival midcampaign should\nbe handled carefully to avoid straining credulity.\nMake sure a player is comfortable with new developments\nabout their character before introducing them.\nCharacter-Focused Adventures.\nAdventures should occasionally highlight character motivations or\nelements of their backstory. Here are a few examples of character-focused adventures:\nArrival from a character’s past shows up\nto settle a grudge.\n+  Asneaky character puts their skills to the test by\nleading the rest of the party to conduct\na\nheist.\n+ A character learns the location ofa magic item\nneeded to save their hometown.\n+  A spellcasting character must undertake a\njoin an exclusive group ofspellcasters.\nAny adventure that focuses on a single character\nshould incentivize the whole party to participate—\neven if just to help their companion. Avoid\nfocusing adventures on one character too often, and look for\nopportunities to have character-focused adventures\nfor each character from time to time,\nSetting New Goals. Characters can change their\ngoals whenever they please, but you can encourage\nthem to do so by giving them significant victories\nroughly every 5 levels. When characters accomplish\ntheir goals, consider the following questions:\n+  How does completing this goal create a new\nchallenge?\n+  How is this victory only part of what the character\nwants to achieve?\n+ Who might be upset by the character completing\nthis goal?\n+ What is a reward the character will be excited\nto receive that also moves them closer to their\nambition?\nUse the answers to these questions to develop new\ncharacter goals and to inspire further adventures.\nBuilding on the Characters’ Actions. Sometimes\nit can be fun to let the players steer the campaign\nby having their characters’ actions dictate future\nadventures. For example, if the characters buy a\ntavern using the treasure they've amassed, you can\nadjust the campaign so that the tavern has a role in,\nfuture adventures. One adventure might involve a\ncompetitor trying to put the characters’ tavern out\nof business. Another might use the tavern as the\nsetting for a murder mystery.\nCAMPAIGN \nCONFLICTS\n‘One way to ensure your campaign's longevity\nis to come up with three compelling conflicts you can\ncreate adventures around. Introduce these conflicts\nearly in the campaign.\nAs the campaign unfolds, focus adventures on different conflicts to keep the\nplayers’ excitement high.\nUse the Campaign Conflicts tracking sheet to record your campaign's conflicts (with room to add\ndetails or notes). A conflict can be as big or as small\nas you like, and it’s nice to have at least one conflict,\nthat can be resolved quickly. Each conflict should\ninvolve the adventurers against some antagonistic\nforce, though you can also create conflicts between\ntwo powerful forces without necessarily knowing\nwhich force (if either) the adventurers will align\nthemselves with. The “Flavors of Fantasy” section\nbelow provides examples of conflicts that reinforce\nparticular themes.\nIfa conflict reaches a satisfying end before the\nend of the campaign, create a new conflict to\nreplace it. You can also replace conflicts that don't\nresonate with your players as well as conflicts\nyou're having trouble building adventures around.\nConFLicT Arcs\nIn the same way you think about character ares\nover the course of a campaign, think about how\neach conflict might manifest over the course of the\ncampaign. How do the characters first encounter\nthe conflict? How does the conflict develop over\ntime? What might a climactic ending to that conflict look like?\n‘One helpful way to structure a conflict arc is to\nuse the tiers of play described in chapter 4. Levls 5, 11, and 17 represent milestones in character\npower and capabilities, and they can also be story\nmilestones in the arc of your campaign. The shift\nfrom one tier to another is an ideal time to wrap up\na campaign conflict and introduce a new one that\nhas a broader reach and represents a greater threat.\nThe threshold ofa new tier can also be an opportunity for characters to realize the scale of a conflict\nthey've been dealing withto realize, for example,\nthat the bandits they fought throughout their first\nfour levels are merely puppets of an enemy nation\nthey must confront in the second tier.\n‘The “Greyhawk” section in this chapter has\nexamples of conflict arcs.","tokenEstimate":1159,"keywords":["friends","and","foes","adventurer","take","note","specific","background","characters","family","members","others","who","might","appear","the","campaign","should","these","become"]},{"id":"dmg-534","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 7: Treasure","Flavors of Fantasy"],"heading":"Flavors of Fantasy","content":"Your D&D campaign might be inspired by a particular flavor of fantasy, several of which are discussed in the sections that follow.

Describe any current or past events\nthat help frame the campaign.\nFor example, the campaign might start on\nthe heels of a great war or on the day of\na \nfestival.\nDescribing key events helps set the mood\nand prepare players for upcoming adventures.\nHouse\nRules. \nIf you're using any house rules\n(as discussed in chapter\n2),\nor adopting any of the variant rules presented\nin this or any other book, let your players\nknow about them.\nRemember, you'll always know more about your\ncampaign world than the players do.\nHaving spent all their lives in this world,\nthough, the characters also know more than\ntheir players do.\nFill in the basics of what the characters\nshould know anytime that information matters\nto their adventures.\nSTARTING \nLocaTION\nBegin your campaign in a location you can\ndetail, such as a village, a neighborhood\nin a larger city, an outpost, or a roadside\ntavern. \nBe prepared to give players enough information about\nthat location to help them figure out what\nties, if any, their characters have to it.\nOnce you have this campaign hub fleshed out,\ncreate one or two local attractions\n\nthat might serve as adventure locations, such as a\nhaunted house on the outskirts of town or a dungeon complex tucked in the nearby hills.\nIf you're using a published campaign setting, pick\nany location in that setting and develop it as you\nlike. A published setting or adventure might give\nyou all the details you need. The Free City of Greyhawk, described later in this chapter, is an ideal\nstarting location and illustrates the kinds of things\nto consider as you detail a starting location.\nIf you're building your own setting, start small by\ndetailing only this starting area. The rest of your\nsetting can remain  undeveloped for now. Don't\nspend too much time fleshing out the geopolitical\nlandscape of your world or locations the adventurers aren't likely to visit right away; save those fun\ntasks for when you and your players have a better\nsense of where the campaign is headed.","tokenEstimate":1088,"keywords":["bringing","the","party","together","during","session","zero","help","players","come","with","explanations","for","how","their","characters","know","each","other","and"]},{"id":"dmg-541","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 7: Treasure","Bringing the Party Together","First ADVENTURE"],"heading":"First ADVENTURE","content":"If you're using a published adventure to launch\nyour campaign, use the character hooks in that adventure to bring the characters from their starting\nlocation to the adventure’s action.

Each new\nadventure plants new seeds in the garden, which\nrequires regular tending lest it run wild. Over time,\nyour campaign will grow and flourish in ways you\nexpected and in ways that will surprise you. You\nmight need to weed out elements that aren't resonating with your players while planting new elements to tantalize them.\nMost D&D campaigns grow organically, rather\nthan having all their elements set in stone from\nthe get-go. From time to time, the characters’ decisions will require you to improvise and create new\ncampaign elements on the fly. For example, anew\nlocation might need to be developed to address the\nneeds of the unfolding story, or certain NPCs might\nneed fleshing out at a moment's notice. Other parts\nof this book, such as the “Nonplayer Characters”\nand “Settlements” sections in chapter 3, can help\nyou expand your campaign quickly.\nEPISODES \nAND \nSERIALS\nThere are two basic ways to think about how\nadventures fit together in your campaign: as distinct\nepisodes or as a serialized story. If you're not sure\nwhich type of campaign to run, ask your players\nwhat they prefer: If your players have different preferences, you can intersperse episodic, stand-alone\nadventures among serialized adventures to break\nup the bigger story.\nEPISODES\nAn episodic campaign is a  campaign in which the\ncomponent adventures don't combine to form an\noverarching story. Episodic adventures are standalone quests, and the villains who appear in one\nadventure rarely resurface to trouble the characters\nagain. If your game group plays infrequently, an episodic campaign might be ideal because the players\ncan enjoy the current adventure even if they've for~\ngotten the details of earlier adventures.\nStarting a New Episode. In an episodic campaign,\nthe start ofa new adventure doesn't necessarily\nhave any connection to the end of the last one. The\naction might pick up immediately after the end of\nthe previous adventure, but it might instead begin\nweeks, months, or years after the last adventure,\nallowing interim events to unfold while the characters take a break from adventuring.\nSERIALS\nA serialized campaign is one continuous story broken up into smaller parts that flow naturally from\none to the next. It often has one or more overarching threats, and the outcome of one adventure can\naffect how the rest of the campaign unfolds. If your\ngame group meets regularly and often, a serialized\ncampaign allows you to keep your players guessing\nwhat will come next as the campaign builds toward\na satisfying conclusion.\nLinking Adventures. In a serialized campaign,\nmake connections between the end of one adventure and the start of the next to help it feel like a\nconnected story. Sometimes you can simply continue the current storyline with new locations to\nexplore and new threats to overcome. Alternatively,\nyou can use the Adventure Connections table to\ninspire a link from one adventure to the next. The\ntable suggests things you can do near the end of one\nadventure to lead characters into the next one.","tokenEstimate":763,"keywords":["plan","adventures","campaign","like","garden","each","new","adventure","plants","seeds","the","which","requires","regular","tending","lest","run","wild","over","time"]},{"id":"dmg-543","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 7: Treasure","Adventure Connections","Adventure Connection"],"heading":"Adventure Connection","content":"1  Introduce a person, an object, or information that the characters need to transport\nsafely to a location involved in the new\nadventure.\n2 Have a major villain flee to a location that\nfeatures in the new adventure.

hostile neighbors. These\nnations have little centralized authority or military\nPower, so the knights have historically served as a\nCHAPTER 5 \nGREYHAWK\nfirst line of defense against these varied\nthreats.

Histories\nand fireside tales are filled with the exploits\nof those who wield magic.\nWhat normal folk know of magic depends on\nwhere they live and whether they know people\nwho practice magic.\nCitizens of an isolated hamlet might not\nhave seen true magic used for generations\nexcept the strange powers of the old hermit\nliving in the nearby woods, which they regard with\nsuspicion and mention only in whispers.\nBy contrast, magic is common enough in the\nFree City of\nGreyhawk that the Guild of\nWizardry teaches magic and sells spellcasting services.\nExtensive codes of law govern the use and abuse\nof magic.\nThe law treats magical coercion as a major\ncrime, and punishes the public use of magic\nin situations that could harm people or property.\nMysteries or \nGREYHAWK\nEastern erik is a realm of many mysteries, several\nof which are described below.\nBat-Folk of Hepmonaland.

who lived in what is now\nthe\nDry\nSteppes called down arain of colorless fire\nthat burned all living things, ignited the\nlandscape, and reduced the Suloise lands\nto ashes, creating the\nSea of\nDust. \nIn retaliation,\nSuloise survivors invoked their own magic\nto devastate the\nBaklunish lands.\nWhat magic was responsible for the\nRain of\nColorless Fire and the\nInvoked\nDevastation?\nWhat would happen if such magic fell into\nthe wrong hands today?\nAccentral portion of the\nDry\nSteppes, where the seat of the\nBaklunish empire stood, is said to remain\npleasant and rich, roamed by\nBaklunish nomads.\n‘The former\nSuloise capital, by contrast, in the heart\nof the\nSea of\nDust, is beset by howling winds, terrible\ndust storms, and rains of

At that time, the\nGreat Kingdom ofAerdy stretched from the Vast\n‘Swamp to the Rakers, and from the Solnor Ocean\nto the Yatil and Lortmil Mountains. Between the\nLortmil Mountains and the Crystalmists was the\nKingdom of Keoland, mimicking the Great Kingdom in its imperialist approach. To the west of the\nmountains, the Baklunish nations—survivors of the\nInvoked Devastation—stood much as they do now.\nAnd to the north, nomadic peoples (the Chakyik,\nthe Wegwiur, the rovers of the Hunting Lands) and\nthe North Kingdoms were, as now, independent of\nthe politics of the south.\n‘The contraction of the two southern realms over\nthe last two centuries is the primary force that has\nshaped the modern Flanaess. First, the provinces\nof Perrenland, Veluna, and Furyondy—far from the\noverking’s throne in Rauxes—declared their independence from the Great Kingdom. When Nyrond\njoined them (in 356 CY), the stage was set for the\nslow disintegration of the Great Kingdom and the\nongoing rebellion that dominates the eastern part of,\nthe Flanaess to this day.\n‘The beginning of Aerdy’s decline marked the\nhigh-water mark of Keoland’s expansionist policies, as it held sway from the Pomarj to the borders\nof Ket. Aided by Celene, rebels in the Ulek region\nstrove to curb the kingdom's warlike ways, and the\naccession of King Tavish IV in 453 CY marked a\ndramatic shift in royal policy. The Yeomanry and\nthe Ulek states were granted autonomy, the Gran\nMarch and Sterich became semi-independent while\nremaining loyal to the crown, and the diverse\npeoples ofthis region coexist in relative peace\nonce again.\nWith this big picture in mind, you can think of the\nFlanaess beyond the Free City of Greyhawk as five\nmajor regions, each with its own store ofadventure\npossibilities waiting to be explored:\nCentral Flanaess. Diverse peoples clash against luz\nand the forces of Elemental Evil.\nEastern Flanaess. The remnants of the Great Kingdom struggle to determine the fate ofthe lands in\nthe overking’s wicked clutches.\nNorthern Flanaess. In vast wilderness expanses\npopulated by indigenous folk, one’s mettle is\ntested by the environment and roving dragons.\nOld Keoland. The former provinces of Keoland\ncontend against evil monsters from the western\nmountains, including dragons and giants.\nWestern Flanaess. The Baklunish peoples and.\nnations navigate complex political relationships.","tokenEstimate":703,"keywords":["greyhawk","gazetteer","the","poster","map","this","book","shows","entire","region","flanaess","with","free","city","near","center","characters","venture","beyond","confines"]},{"id":"dmg-570","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 7: Treasure","Greyhawk Gazetteer","Livine History"],"heading":"Livine History","content":"Greyhawk has a long history of ancient empires\nand more recent wars, but the only relevant\ndetails of this history are those that feature in\nyour adventures.

The forces of evil were smashed, and\ntheir remnants were driven back into the\ndungeons under their stronghold, the\nTemple of\nElemental\nEvil.\nThe forces of good, under the command of Prince\nThrommel\nIV\nof\nFuryondy, besieged the temple, which fell\nin a fortnight.\nOnly a few of the temple's wicked leaders escaped,\nand it is suspected that these individuals\nwere responsible for the subsequent kidnapping of the\nprince.\nPrince\nThrommel was engaged to marry Lady\nJolene, a priest from a prominent noble family of\nCHAPTER 5 \nGREYHAWK\nVeluna. \nTheir marriage would have united\nFuryondy and Veluna as a single entity, with\nthe canon of\nVeluna ruling in matters spiritual and the\nking of\nFuryondy ruling in matters temporal.\nThis combined state, with its powerful elf allies\nin\nCelene, could wage a steady war against the\nevil plaguing\nEastern\nOerik.\nThe prince's disappearance has stalled these\nplans.\nTue \nRise oF luz luz is the offspring of the demon\nlord Graz'zt and a human archmage named\nIggwilv.\nFor ages, he ruled the lands from the\nHowling\nHills to\nLake\nWhyestil, naming his domain after himself.\nThese lands are so despoiled and dangerous\nthat the otherwise fierce nomads of the\nHunting Lands and\nWegwiur pass through the\nCold Marshes rather than enter the merest edge of\nluz’s realm.\nuz's evil reign was interrupted by a sixty-five\nyear imprisonment in the dungeon under\nCastle\nGreyhawk.

A Bastion offers a character temporary refuge from the\ndangerous world of adventuring, and it provides\nopportunities for a character to craft magic items,\nconduct research, harvest poisons, build ships, and\ncarry out a range of other activities.\n‘As DM, you decide whether Bastions are available in a campaign. Bastions are best suited to\ncampaigns that allow characters to return to their\nBastions during intervals when they're not actively\nadventuring. Not every character needs to have\na Bastion, It's fine for some players in your campaign to opt in to Bastion ownership and others to\nopt out.\nThere's no need to choose between going on adventures and commanding a Bastion; a character\ncan do both at once. A Bastion has special  facilities\nthat generate benefits, and these facilities can also\nundertake projects while the character is otherwise\n‘occupied.\nMost importantly, a Bastion is a creative playground for a player and a shared storytelling space\nin the campaign, Be as permissive as you can with\nthe stories players tell in their  Bastions, but players\nshould know their control might be limited by the\ncampaign's larger story, which you strive to make\nfun for everyone.\nGAINING A BASTION\nIf you allow Bastions in your campaign, characters\nacquire their Bastions when they reach level 5. You\nand the players can decide together how these Bastions come into being. A character might inherit or\nreceive a parcel of land on which to build their Bastion (see “Marks of Prestige” in chapter 5), or they\nmight take a preexisting structure and refurbish\nit. It's fair to assume that work has been going on\nbehind the scenes of the campaign during a character’s early adventuring career, so the Bastion is\nready when the character reaches level 5.\nThe shape, style, and function of a character's\nBastion are up to the player to determine. For example, a Wizard might build a tower, a Cleric might\nestablish a shrine, a Fighter might build a fortified\nkeep or similar stronghold, and a Rogue might\nestablish a guildhall or lodge. Characters of other\nclasses might choose one of these forms or combine\nthem~a Paladin’s Bastion might be similar toa Clerie’s shrine but as fortified as a Fighter's stronghold.\nAnd multiple characters can combine their Bastions\nto form a single large structure (see “Bastion Map”).\nEvery Bastion has facilities that serve basic needs\nas well as special  ones, such as libraries, menageries,\nand workshops (see “Basic Facilities” and “Special\nFacilities”).","tokenEstimate":663,"keywords":["chapter","bastions","bastion","location","that","belongs","toa","player","character","home","stronghold","anda","place","power","the","develops","over","course","campaign","offers"]},{"id":"dmg-585","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 8: Bastions","Bastion Turns"],"heading":"Bastion Turns","content":"As  time  passes in the campaign, players take Bastion turns to reflect the activity occurring in their\nBastions, whether or not the characters are present.\nOna Bastion turn, a character can issue orders to\nthe special facilities in their Bastion or issue the\nMaintain order to the entire Bastion (see “Orders’).","tokenEstimate":78,"keywords":["bastion","turns","time","passes","the","campaign","players","take","reflect","activity","occurring","their","bastions","whether","not","characters","are","present","ona","turn"]},{"id":"dmg-586","source":"DMG","headingPath":["Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)","Chapter 8: Bastions","Frequency of Bastion Turns"],"heading":"Frequency of Bastion Turns","content":"By default, a Bastion turn occurs every 7 days of\nin-game time.

After the characters have been\naway for 7 days, you might say, “Time for a\nBastion turn. Since you're not there, we'll assume\nyou issue the Maintain order for your Bastions.”\n‘Then roll for events as described in the “Bastion\nEvents” section in this chapter.\n+  The characters spend 7 days or more in their\nBastions between adventures. You might say,\n“You have six weeks to spend in your Bastions. Go\nahead and resolve six Bastion turns.”\n+  The characters return to their Bastions in the\nmidst of an adventure. You might say, “You have\njust enough time to take a Bastion turn before you\neave again in the morning.”\n+  The characters are adventuring near their Bastions and resting in their Bastions at night. You\nmight say, “It's been a week since your last Bastion\nturn, so you can take one now.”\nYou can slow the frequency of Bastion turns to better serve the needs of your players and your campaign. For example, if the characters have months\nbetween adventures, you can call for a Bastion turn\nevery month instead of every 7 days, so the characters aren't issuing so many orders or reaping too\nmany benefits at once.\nCHAPTER 8 |  BASTIONS 333\n\n‘A Roave’s Bastion ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN\nCONTAINS \nA\nGUILOMALL, \nA\nPUB, \nANO\nMone!\nEncourage play characters’ Bastions, configuring its facilities as\nthey see fit and using the same technique:\nee “Dungeons” in chapter\n3 and “Adventure Maps”  in chapter 4)\nIn addition to basic and special  facilities (described later in this chapter),a Bastion can have the\nfollowing features:\nClosets.

A character's Bastion\ninitially has two special facilities of the character's\nchoice for which they qualify. Each special facility\ncan be chosen only once unless its description says\notherwise.\nUnlike basic facilities, special facilities can't be\nbought; a character gains them through level advancement. At level 9, a character gains two additional special facilities of their choice for which\nthey qualify; they gain one additional facility at\nlevel 13 and another at level 17. The Special Facility\nAcquisition table shows the total number\nof special facilities in a character's Bastion. Each new special\nfacility immediately becomes part of the character's\nBastion when the character reaches the level.\nEach time a character gains a level, that\ncharacter can replace one oftheir Bastion’s special fac\nwith another for which the character qualifies.\n‘SPECIAL \nFACILITY\nACQUISITION\nSpecial\nLevel  level  Facilities\nREQUIREMENTS\nEach special facility has a level. A character must\nbe that level or higher to gain that facility.\nA\nspecial facility might also have a prerequisite the character\nmust meet to gain that facility. For example, only a\ncharacter who can use an Arcane Focus or a tool as\na Spellcasting Focus can have an Arcane Study.\nSPACE\nA special facility occupies a certain amount of\nspace (see “Facility Space”). A  player can configure\nthe squares of a special facility as desired\non the\nBastion’s map. A special facility can be enlarged to\ngrant additional benefits ifits description says so.\nCHAPTERS \nBASTIONS  335\n\nHIRELINGS\nA special facility comes with one or more hirelings\nwho work in the facility, maintain it, and execute\nBastion orders there, as described in the next section. A player can assign names and personalities to\nhirelings in their character's Bastion using the same\ntools DMs use to create NPCs (see chapter 3).\nEach special facility in a Bastion generates enough\nincome to pay the salary of its hirelings. Hirelings\nfollow the orders they're given and are loyal to the\nBastion’s owner.\nORDERS\nOn a Bastion turn, a character in their Bastion can\nissue special orders—called Bastion orders—to one\nor more of their Bastion's special facilities. A character needn't issue orders to all the special facilities\nin their Bastion on a given Bastion turn.\nThe Maintain order is unusual; it is issued to the\nwhole Bastion rather than to one or more special\nfacilities. If a character isn't in their Bastion on a\ngiven Bastion turn, the Bastion acts as though it\nwere issued the Maintain order on that turn unless\nthe owner can communicate with the Bastion hirelings using the Sending spell or similar magic.\nThe orders are as follows:\nCraft. Hirelings in the special facility craft an item\nthat can be made in that facility. During the time\nrequired to craft an item, the facility can’t be used\nto craft anything else, even if a special ability allows the facility to carry out two orders at once.\n‘The hirelings have proficiencies with Artisan's\nTools as specified in the facility's description.\nEmpower. The special facility confers a temporary\nempowerment to you or someone else.\nHarvest. Hirelings gather a resource produced in\nthe special facility. During the time required to\nharvest a resource, the facility can't be used to\nharvest anything else, even if a special ability allows the facility to carry out two orders at once.\nMaintain, All the Bastion’s hirelings focus on maintaining the Bastion rather than executing orders\nin special facilities. Issuing this order prohibits\nother orders from being issued to the Bastion on\nthe current Bastion turn. Each time the Maintain\norder is issued, the DM rolls once on the Bastion\nEvents table at the end of this chapter. Bastion\nevents are resolved before the next Bastion turn,\nRecruit. Hirelings recruit creatures to the Bastion.\nThese creatures might include one or more Bastion Defenders, whose main purpose is to defend\nthe Bastion if it is attacked (see “Bastion Events”\nat the end of this chapter). The Bastion generates\nenough income to provide for the needs of its Bastion Defenders.\n\nResearch.\ninformation.\nTrade. Hirelings buy and sell goods or services\nstored or produced in this special facility.\nSPECIAL FACILITy DESCRIPTIONS\nSpecial facilities are presented in alphabetical order.

See the\nPlayer's Handbook for information on Armor Class.\n\nINITIATIVE\nThe\nInitiative entry specifies the monster's\nInitiative modifier followed by the monster's\nInitiative score in parentheses.\nUse the modifier when you roll to determine\na\nmonster's\nInitiative. A monster's\nInitiative modifier is typically equal to\nits\nDexterity modifier, but some monsters have additional modifiers, \"\nsuch as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that\nnumber.\nIf you don't want to roll a monster's\nInitiative, use the\nInitiative score as the monster's\nInitiative in combat. Initiative is further\ndetailed in the\nPlayer's\nHandbook.\nHIT\n POINTS\nA\nmonster's Hit Points are presented as a number\nfollowed by parentheses, where the monster's\nHit\nPoint\nDice are provided, along with any contribution from\nits\nConstitution.

Some\nmonsters have one or more of the following speeds:\nBurrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these\nspeci\"als speeds appear in the\nPlayer's Handbook.\nABILITY  SCORES\nEvery monster has six ability scores along with corresponding ability score modifiers and saving throw\nmodifiers. For more information on ability scores\nand saving throws, see the Player's Handbook.\nSKILLS\nThe\nSkills entry specifies a monster's skill proficiencies,\nif any. For example, a monster that is very\nperceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to\nWisdom\n(Perception) and Dexterity\n(Stealth) checks. A skill bonus is the sum\nof a monster's relevant ability modifier\nand its Proficiency Bonus.\nOther modifiers might apply.\nRESISTANCES  AND\n VULNERABILITIES\nThese entries list a monster's\nResistances and\nVulnerabilities, if any. See the\nPlayer's Handbook for more information.\nIMMUNITIES\nThis entry lists the monster's Immunities, if\nany.

For example, a\nmonster that wears clothes is assumed to\nbe dressed appropriately, and those clothes\naren't in this entry.\nEquipment mentioned outside the Gear entry\nis considered to be supernatural or highly specialized,\nand it is unusable when the monster is defeated.\nAMMUNITION\nAND  RANGED ATTACKS\nA\nmonster that requires ammunition to make\nranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition.\nEQUIPPING\nA\n MONSTER WITH\n OTHER\nITEMS\nYou may equip monsters with additional gear however you like, using the equipment chapter of the\nPlayer's Handbook for inspiration.

If you do give a monster a magic\nitem, the monster can have Attunement with magic\nitems as noted in the Player's Handbook.

If the monster has M ultiattack, have\nit use Multi attack on any of its turns in\nwhich it's  not using one of its  more powerful abilities.\nBonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions.  If\nthe monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions,  or\nLegendary Actions in its stat block, make sure\nit uses them as often as it can.\nSENSES\nThe\nSenses entry specifies a monster's\nPassive Perception score, as well as any\nspecial senses the monster possesses. Passive\nPerception and special senses are described\nin the\nPlayer's Handbook.\nLANGUAGES\nThis entry lists languages that the monster can\nuse to communicate. Sometimes a monster can understand\na\nlanguage but can't communicate with it, which\nis noted in its entry.\n\"None\" indicates that a creature doesn't comprehend any\nlanguage.\nTELEPATHY\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a\ncreature to communicate mentally with another creature\nwithin a specified range. See the\nPlayer's Handbook for more information.\nCHALLENGE  RATING\nChallenge Rating is defined in the\nPlayer's Handbook, while guidance on using\nCR\nto plan potential combat encounters is in the\nDungeon Master's Guide.\nLists of monsters organized by\nChallenge Rating appear in appendix\nB.\nEXPERIENCE  POINTS\nThe number of\nExperience Points (XP) a monster is worth\nis based on its CR, as detailed in the\nExperience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is\nawarded for defeating the monster in combat or\notherwise neutralizing it.\nUnless a rule says otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or another magical ability is\nworth the XP noted in its stat block.\n8  _6  INTRODUCTION  I HOW TO  USE  A  MONSTER\nEXPERIENCE\n POINTS\n BY\n CHALLENGE  RATING\nCR\n XP  CR  XP\n0  0 or 10  14  11,500\n1/8\n 13,000\n1/4\n so\n 15,000\n1/2  100\n 18,000\nl  200\n 20,000\n2  450\n 22,000\n3  700  20  25,000\n4  1,100\n 33,000\n5  1,800  22  41,000\n6  2,300\n 50,000\n7  2,900  24  62,000\n8  3,900\n 75,000\n9  5,000  26  90,000\n10  5,900\n 27  l 05,000\n 7,200  28  120,000\n 8,400  29  135,000\n l 0,000  30  155,000\nP~OFICIENCY BONUS\nA\nmonster's Proficiency Bonus (PB) is determined\nby its CR, as shown in the\nProficiency Bonus by\nChallenge Rating table, and is reflected in saving\nthrows, skills, and other statistics where\nthe monster's exceptional aptitude is a factor.\nPROFICIENCY  BONUS\n BY\n CHALLENGE  RATING\nCR\n PB\n CR\n PB\n0-4\n +2  17-20  +6\n5-8\n9-12\n13-16","tokenEstimate":1877,"keywords":["monster","manual","2025","def","ult","suggestion","how","roleplay","the","inspired","its","traditional","role","game","realworld","folk","lore","change","monster's","alignment"]},{"id":"mm-2","source":"MM","headingPath":["Monster Manual (2025)","Traits"],"heading":"Traits","content":"21-24\n25-28\n29-30\nA\nmonster's traits, if any, are features that are\nactive at all times or in certain situations.","tokenEstimate":29,"keywords":["traits","21-24","25-28","29-30","monster's","any","are","features","that","active","all","times","certain","situations"]},{"id":"mm-3","source":"MM","headingPath":["Monster Manual (2025)","Actions"],"heading":"Actions","content":"A\nmonster can take the actions in this section or\ntake one of the actions available to all\ncreatures, as described in the\nPlayer's Handbook.\nATTACK NOTATION\nThe entry for a monster's attack identifies\nwhether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then\nprovides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range,\nand what happens on a hit.

For\nexample, an attack might deal 4  (ld4 + 2) damage\non a hit. You decide whether to use the number or\nthe die expression in parentheses; don't use both.\nMULTIATTACK\nSome creatures can make more than one attack\nwhen they take the Attack action. Such creatures\nhave the Multiattack entry in the\n\"Actions\" section of their stat block. This\nentry details the attacks a creature can\nmake, as well as any additional abilities\nit can use, as part of the Attack action.\nSPELLCASTING \nIf a monster can cast any spells, its stat\nblock lists the spells and provides the monster's spellcasting\nability, spell save DC (if any spells require\na saving throw), and spell attack bonus (if\nany spells require an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell\nof level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible\nlevel and can't be cast at a higher level.\nA monster's spell can have special rules or\nrestrictions. For example, a green slaad can cast the\nInvisibility spell, but the spell has a \"self only\" restriction,\nwhich means the spell affects only the slaad.\nSpell Components.  The Spellcasting trait\nnotes whether the monster's spellcasting ignores the need\nfor certain spell components. If any spell components are required, describe the monster's use of\nVerbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal\nto characters that it is casting a spell. A monster\nthat requires Material components has them.\nCasting Times of\nMinutes.

What\ncloakers call themselves is un1<:nown, if they refer to\nthemselves at all. Though they're undeniably intelligent, their behavior is often inscrutable.\nCloakers sometimes gather in Underdark enclaves,\nbut they rarely build settlements or form social\nstructures. Most operate as solitary predators, lurking in dismal subterranean reaches or abandoned\ndungeons-sometimes for months at a time-as they\nwait for prey to pass. They use their mottled hides\nto blend in with their surroundings. When unsuspecting prey nears, cloal<:ers unfurl and attempt\nto latch on and then smother their victims in their\npowerful wings.\nCloakers delight in frightening foes. In addition\nto their methods of ambush, cloakers can create\nillusory duplicates of themselves and emit surreal\nmoans that non-cloakers find terrifying in unexplainable, primal ways. Cloakers might antagonize\nexplorers lost in the Underdark for days, terrorizing\nand scattering them before attacking. They rarely\nconverse with other beings, except to whisper eerie\nriddles to those they're about to consume.\nCLOAKER\nLarge Abe rrat ion , Chaotic  Neutral\nAC 14  Initiative +5  (15)\nHP 91  (l4dl0 + 14)\nSpeed l Oft.,  Fly 40 ft.\nMOD  SAVE  MOD  SAVE  MOD  SAVE\nSTR  17  +3  +3  DEX  15  +2  +2  CON 12  +l  +l\nINT  13  +l  +l  Wis  14  +2  +2  CHA  7  -2  -2\nSkills Stealth +5\nImmunities Frightened\nSenses  Darkvision 120 ft.; Passive Perception  12\nLanguages Deep Speech,  Undercommon\nCR 8 (XP 3,900;  PB +3)\nTRAI TS\nLight Sensitivity.

These deathless dragons bind their spirits to gems and magically animate their rotting corpses. Eventually\nbecoming skeletal horrors, dracoliches continue the\ncenturies-spanning plots they pursued in life, seek\nrevenge on those that brought them low, and strive\ntoward vicious goals they couldn't indulge in life.\nDracoliches combine the corrupt immortality of\nthe undead with the legendary power of dragons. A\ndracolich retains a breath weapon, but it is a chilling\nnecrotic blast. These terrors gradually sicken the\nland near their lairs and attract sinister followersusually other undead or cultists seeking to revel\nin their terrible might. Living dragons of all types\nloathe and seek to destroy dracoliches, viewing\nthem as distortions of draconic magic.\nThere are untold profane routes by which a\ndragon might become a dracolich. However one is\ncreated, a dracolich chooses a gem that becomes the\nanchor for its spirit and binds the deathless dragon\nto the world. So long as a dracolich is on the same\nplane of existence as its soul gem, the dracolich\ncan survive the destruction of its physical body. Its\nspirit retreats into the gem if the dracolich's body is\ndestroyed, and the monster might one day regain its\nterrifying form.

Those in\na gorgon's territory must remain vigilant\nand aware of the monster's exact position,\nor they risk being attacked by a gorgon they thought\nwas no longer a threat.\nThose who create gorgons strive to give them\npurposefully obscure command keys.

The oldest\ngorgons might be covered in rust, but this rarely\nimpedes their abilities. These gorgons' stomping\ngrounds are littered with the shattered remains of\npetrified foes.\nMany gorgons outlive their creators by centuries, misleading some to believe these creations have\nnatural origins and territories. Most such gorgons continue to follow age-old commands,\nguarding sites long fallen to ruin.\nBRAZEN  GORGON\nFollowers of the exiled archdevil Moloch altered the\nprocess of creating gorgons to craft their own diabolical guardians called brazen gorgons. These gorgons are hollow, bull-like automatons whose metal\nbodies glow with intense heat. When they charge\ntheir foes, the ribs of their frames open like cages to\nensnare enemies and roast them within. Brazen gorgons are often found in blasphemous sites dedicated\nto Moloch, other archdevils, or bloodthirsty gods.\n\nn::\nw\nfzw n::\nlJ\nN\nOTr\\B\nL E\n/\\M\nO\nNG\nMY\nE\nCC\nENTR\nI C\nr\\N\nC\nEST\nO R 1\nS S C\nr\\TTERED\nDES\nIG\nNS\nWr\\S\nA\nSCHE\nM\nAT\nI C O F r\\\nSWAM\nLLI\nNG\nB O\nVI\nNE\nMON\nAN\nD\nAN\nOMI\nNO\nTE\nTTER.\"\nLUM\nTHE\n MAE\nS\nTR\nO , A\nMIN\nD\nOF\nM E\nTAL\nBRAZEN\nLarge\nConstruct1 Unaligned\nAC 19  In iti ati ve +2  (12)\nHP\n(17dl0+68)\nSpeed 40 ft.\nMOD\n SAVE\n MOD\n SAVE\n MOD\n SAVE\nSTR \n +4  +4  DEX \n14  +2  +2  CON 19  +4  +4\nINT  2\n - 4  Wis  14  +2  +2  CHA  7\n -2  -2\nSkills Perception + l 0\nImmu niti es Fire; Exhaustion, Petrified\nSens es Darkvision 60 ft.; Passive Perception  20\nLan gu ages None\nCR\n9 (XP 5,000;\n PB\n+4)\nT RAI TS\nFlame Aura.

With their souls preserved\nin hidden relics, liches puppet their own corpses as\nthey pursue ambitions free from mortal bonds.\nLiches possess exceptional cunning and magical\nprowess, and they use their unnatural immortality\nto pursue arcane secrets few could grasp in a single life. Uncanny agendas lead them to piumb the\nsecrets of life, the multiverse, godhood, and less\nfathomable topics. Careless of mortal lives or desires, liches go to any lengths to achieve their goals.\nA lich's age and origin influences its form. Older\nliches appear as little more than brittle skeletons\nclad in the rotten finery of forgotten empires, while\nyounger liches more closely resemble living creatures and are clad in contemporary garb. Many\ncloak themselves in illusions of their idealized mortal forms.\nAlthough liches don't fear death, they're not free\nfrom the ravages of time. Over ages, some liches\nlose their connection to time and the physical\nworld, degenerating into demiliches.\nLICH  SPIRIT JARS\nThe process of becoming a lich is involved, dangerous, and unique to each would-be lich. If the\nrite succeeds, the lich's soul is bound to a spirit jar,\na specially prepared magical repository. This relic\nanchors the lich's spirit to the world and preserves\nit should the lich's body be destroyed. A lich can\nbe slain only if its spirit jar is ruined. As such, a\nlich goes to great lengths to hide and protect its\nspirit jar.\nSpirit jars are typically small, well-made objects\nthat were meaningful to a lich in life.

These abominations can also shape-shift into\nsnakes.

Abominations avoid jeopardizing themselves, typically scheming fro m hidden bastions\nwhere they're protected by yuan -ti and serpent\nguardians . These coldhearted leaders have a unique\nunderstanding of the supernatural forces that\ngrant yuan-ti their powers, and they usually have\ninsidious magical traps and contingencies at their\ndisposal.\nY U AN - TI\nG RE A T MA G IC, T W ISTE D AN D C OR R UP TED . ..\nM /\\ L IC E BEYOND REC K O N ING ___ FLE SH RE S HAPED,\nBE CO MING SE RP E N TI N E HORRORS -- -\n-L A ST ME s sA G E O F SoRRIL VENIL,\nE X.
