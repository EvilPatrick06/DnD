The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for the duration. When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As a Bonus Action, you can switch between seeing and hearing. A creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from See Invisibility or Truesight) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.",
