The DM chooses the omen from the Omens table: Weal (good), Woe (bad), Weal and woe (good and bad), or Indifference (neither good nor bad). The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results. If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.",
