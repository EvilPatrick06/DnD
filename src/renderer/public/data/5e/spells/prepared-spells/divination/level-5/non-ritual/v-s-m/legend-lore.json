The lore might consist of important details, amusing revelations, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. The more you already know about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is. That information is accurate but might be couched in figurative language or poetry, as determined by the DM. If the famous thing you chose isn't actually famous, you hear sad musical notes played on a trombone, and the spell fails.",
