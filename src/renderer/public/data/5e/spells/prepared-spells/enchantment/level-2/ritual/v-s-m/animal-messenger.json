You specify a location you have visited and a recipient who matches a general description, such as \"a person dressed in the uniform of the town guard\" or \"a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.\" You also communicate a message of up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the duration toward the specified location, covering about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast can fly.\n\nWhen the Beast arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, mimicking your communication. If the Beast doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.",
