If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.\n\nIf the target is held shut by Arcane Lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and closed.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible up to 300 feet away, emanates from the target.",
