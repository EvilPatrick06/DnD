  "description": "Eight rays of light flash from you in a 60-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll 1d8 to determine which color ray affects it. Rays 1–5 deal 12d6 damage of a specific type (half on a successful save). Ray 6 (Indigo) imposes the Restrained condition with repeated Constitution saves; three successes end it, three failures cause the Petrified condition. Ray 7 (Violet) imposes the Blinded condition with a Wisdom save at the start of your next turn; failure ends the Blinded condition and teleports the creature to another plane. On an 8, the target is struck by two rays (roll twice, rerolling any 8).",
