Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn. A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.",
