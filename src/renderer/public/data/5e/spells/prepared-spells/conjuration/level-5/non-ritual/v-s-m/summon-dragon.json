The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger. The Draconic Spirit has AC 14 + the spell's level, HP 50 + 10 for each spell level above 5, Speed 30 ft., Fly 60 ft., Swim 30 ft. STR 19 (+4), DEX 14 (+2), CON 17 (+3), INT 10 (+0), WIS 14 (+2), CHA 14 (+2). Resistances: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison. Immunities: Charmed, Frightened, Poisoned. Senses: Blindsight 30 ft., Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 12. Languages: Draconic, understands the languages you know. Shared Resistances: When you summon the spirit, choose one of its Resistances. You have Resistance to the chosen damage type until the spell ends. Multiattack: The spirit makes a number of Rend attacks equal to half the spell's level (round down). Rend: Melee Attack Roll, bonus equals your spell attack modifier, reach 10 ft. Hit: 1d6 + 4 + the spell's level Piercing damage. Breath Weapon: Dexterity Saving Throw, DC equals your spell save DC, each creature in a 30-foot Cone.
