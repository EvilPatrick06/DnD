  "description": "Yolande *(yoh-LAWND)*, known as the Faerie Queen, is the benevolent and beloved elf monarch of Celene (see chapter 5). Raised in the court of the **Summer Queen**, Yolande had no wish to rule. She preferred the life of an adventuring magic-user. She built her reputation on triumphs, such as her capture of the fomorian brigand Solgna and the theft of the **Prince of Frost**'s sentient sword, *Winterflash*. Yolande was among the first elves to migrate from the Feywild to the Greyhawk setting.",
