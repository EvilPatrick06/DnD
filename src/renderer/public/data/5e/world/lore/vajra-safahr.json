  "description": "Vajra Safahr *(VAWJ-rah sah-FAR)* is a human Wizard in her midthirties, making her the youngest person ever to hold the position of Blackstaff—the chief mage of **Waterdeep** and the head of Blackstaff Academy, a school for mages. Several of the older and more seasoned mages of Waterdeep consider Vajra an upstart, but they are smart enough not to challenge her. As the badge of her office, she carries the *Blackstaff*, an Artifact that holds the spirits of all her predecessors.",
