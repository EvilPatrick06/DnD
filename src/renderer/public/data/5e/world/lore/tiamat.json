  "description": "Tiamat *(TEE-a-mat)* is one of the primordial dragons who (along with **Bahamut**) is said to have created the **First World**. Since the destruction of the First World, she has made her home in the Nine Hells (see chapter 6), where she is served by devils and enjoys the worship of mortals across the multiverse. In the Dragonlance setting, where she is known as Takhisis *(ta-KEE-sis)*, she is the greatest of the gods of evil. On many worlds, she is known as a god of greed, wealth, and vengeance.\n\nChromatic dragons might fear, respect, envy, and appease Tiamat as a sovereign, but they don't worship her. Their devotion to her rarely supersedes their devotion to their own goals.",
