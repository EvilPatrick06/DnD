  "description": "The Yawning Portal is a tavern in **Waterdeep**, built around an entrance to the infamous dungeon of **Undermountain**. Adventurers throughout the Forgotten Realms setting and elsewhere in the multiverse visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but some adventurers pay the toll for entry into Undermountain (collected by the mysterious owner and bartender, Durnan).",
