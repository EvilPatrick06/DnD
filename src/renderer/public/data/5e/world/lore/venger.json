  "description": "Venger *(VEN-jur)* was once both human and goodhearted, but some fiendish force transformed him into a winged, one-horned villain. His schemes have spanned centuries and worlds, as he seeks to seize ever-increasing magical power. He has a particular loathing for **Tiamat** and longs to overthrow her. He is often seen astride a flying black steed, his shadowy adviser in tow.",
