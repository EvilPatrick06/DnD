  "description": "Before she changed her name and conquered enough of Eastern Oerik (the Greyhawk setting) to rightfully call herself the Witch Queen of Perrenland, Iggwilv *(IGG-wilv)* was known as Tasha, a human mage who began her career as the apprentice of Zagig Yragerne (see **Zagyg**). Later, as an adventurer, she created several new spells, including *Tasha's Hideous Laughter* and *Tasha's Bubbling Cauldron*, leaning on the teachings of her adoptive mother, the arch-hag **Baba Yaga**. As Tasha grew in power and made powerful enemies, she changed her name to Iggwilv. In this guise, she became enchanted with the power of the Abyss and wrote the definitive treatise on demonkind: the *Demonomicon of Iggwilv* (see chapter 7). She also bound and trapped the demon lord Graz'zt (see chapter 6).\n\nIggwilv ruled Perrenland as a tyrant. When Graz'zt escaped his magical prison, Iggwilv went into hiding. Iggwilv's current location is unknown, but she left behind a cambion son (**Iuz**), who has his mother's tyrannical bent, and a daughter (Drelnza), who is now a vampire and lairs in the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (see \"Greyhawk Gazetteer\" in chapter 5), not far from her mother's old haunts.",
