  "description": "The frontier town of Phandalin *(FAN-duh-lin or fan-DAY-lin)* in the **Sword Coast** region of the Forgotten Realms setting is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, old Phandalin was a thriving town until it was sacked by bandits and lay abandoned for centuries.\n\nIn the past few years, hardy folk from the cities of **Neverwinter** and **Waterdeep** have begun settling atop the ruins of old Phandalin. It's now home to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains—as well as more than a few ruffians and bandits.",
