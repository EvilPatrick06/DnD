  "description": "One card in the *Deck of Many Things* (see chapter 7) bears a person's proper name, and the card's namesake, Euryale *(YUR-ee-ale or yur-EYE-a-lee)*, is the subject of much speculation. Often assumed to be a fearsome demigod (perhaps the first medusa) or the wielder of a destructive curse, Euryale is actually a key part of the story of the magical deck's creation.\n\nAfter befriending a princess named Asteria and spending many years in her dear friend's company, Euryale was captured and sentenced to death by Asteria's father. Asteria pleaded with the gods to save her friend, and Istus (a god from the Greyhawk setting; see chapter 5) intervened to help the pair rewrite their story, creating the *Deck of Many Things*. The magic of the deck helped the two escape, and they adventured together across the multiverse. Eventually, Euryale—having become an ancient, wise, and powerful Druid—settled in the Outlands (see chapter 6), where she still sometimes acts as a patron, mentor, or ally for adventurers.",
