  "description": "According to legend, Keraptis *(kuh-RAP-tiss)* was an evil archmage who long ago seized power as a petty tyrant somewhere in the northern mountains of the Greyhawk setting. When his demands on the local populace became too extreme, a revolt drove him into hiding. He disappeared into the tunnels beneath White Plume Mountain (see \"Greyhawk's Premise\" in chapter 5). It's conceivable that he became a lich as the grim climax of his magical research.",
