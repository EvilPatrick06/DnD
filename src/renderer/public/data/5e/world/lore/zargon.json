  "description": "Zargon *(ZAR-gawn)* is an **Elder Evil**—an undying abomination from eons past with an insatiable appetite. A tentacled, slime-covered horror with a cyclopic red eye and an indestructible horn, Zargon corrupts creatures it doesn't devour, transforming its victims into amorphous servants. Zargon is imprisoned on the Material Plane in a prison deep in the earth. This prison is described in the *Quests from the Infinite Staircase* adventure anthology.",
