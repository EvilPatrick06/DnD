He is the founder and leader of the Circle of Eight, which he created to implement his philosophy of balance in the world. Among Mordenkainen's celebrated accomplishments are several name-branded spells, including ones that create extradimensional mansions, swords of spectral force, and phantom watchdogs (detailed in the *Player's Handbook*).\n\nMordenkainen has visited numerous worlds and planes of existence, making friends and fomenting rivalries on many of them. He maintains a close friendship with his former apprentice **Bigby** and the famous archmage **Elminster** of Shadowdale. Mordenkainen's greatest rival is **Iggwilv**, a former adventuring companion.",
