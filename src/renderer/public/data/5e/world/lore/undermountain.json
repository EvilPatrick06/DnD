  "description": "Undermountain is the largest, deepest dungeon in the Forgotten Realms setting. It's a series of interconnected dungeon levels sprawling far beneath the city of **Waterdeep**. Its tunnels connect to preexisting **mithral** mines and natural caverns of the **Underdark**. The best-known entrance to Undermountain is through the **Yawning Portal** tavern in Waterdeep, but other routes also exist. A reclusive and cantankerous archmage named Halaster Blackcloak claims Undermountain as his domain, although his overlordship isn't widely acknowledged by the dungeon's other denizens.",
