  "description": "Iuz *(EYE-ooze or eye-OOZE)* is a cambion and the son of **Iggwilv** and Graz'zt (see chapter 6). He is every bit as evil as his father and as bent on conquest as his mother at her very worst. He rules a significant portion of Eastern Oerik (in the Greyhawk setting), and some fear that he aspires to conquer even more territory. See \"Greyhawk's Premise\" in chapter 5.",
