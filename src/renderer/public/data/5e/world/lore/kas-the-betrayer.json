  "description": "Kas *(KOSS)* is a vampire, legendary swordfighter, and ruthless warlord. He once served as the leader of **Vecna**'s armies and the lich's most trusted lieutenant, and he wielded a sword made for him (the *Sword of Kas*, described in chapter 7) by his liege. But the evil sword convinced Kas to betray Vecna, and now Kas is driven primarily by his hatred for his former lord.",
