  "description": "Hadar *(HAY-dar or ha-DARR)*, the Dark Hunger, is an ancient stellar entity originating from the Far Realm (see chapter 6). It appears as a cinder-red dying star, barely visible in the night sky, and it siphons life from its minions to avert its own demise. Two widely used Warlock spells invoke Hadar's power (see the *Arms of Hadar* and *Hunger of Hadar* spells in the *Player's Handbook*), and a few Warlocks claim this **Elder Evil** as their Great Old One patron.",
