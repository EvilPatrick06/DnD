  "description": "It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling in the night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak — and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.",
