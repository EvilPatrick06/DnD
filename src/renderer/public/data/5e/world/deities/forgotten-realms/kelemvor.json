  "description": "Kelemvor is the god of death and the dead, overseeing the transition of souls from life to their final rest. Unlike previous deities of death who were cruel or indifferent, Kelemvor is fair and compassionate. He views death as a natural part of life and despises undead as abominations that pervert the natural cycle. His followers comfort the dying, hunt undead, and ensure the dead are properly buried.",
