  "description": "The surfaces of Bytopia's two layers face each other like the covers of a closed book. Looking up from **Dothion**, the \"top\" layer of the plane, a traveler can see **Shurrock**, its other layer, about a mile overhead. Both layers are idealized worlds that reflect the plane's philosophy of personal achievement alongside social interdependence.\n\n#### Layers of Bytopia\n\n| Layer | Description |\n|---|---|\n| Dothion | Farms nestled among well-tamed woods are hubs of pastoral activity and individual industry. |\n| Shurrock | Small communities thrive around quarries and mills amid rough country and harsh weather. |\n\n#### Bytopia Adventures\n\nBytopia is the heaven of productive work, the satisfaction of a job well done. The goodness flowing through the plane creates feelings of goodwill and happiness in creatures dwelling there. While Dothion rewards those who seek a quiet life, Shurrock is the paradise of those who continually challenge and better themselves.\n\nThe two layers of Bytopia are often referred to as the \"Twin Paradises,\" and it's said that every action carried out on one layer has repercussions on the other—an equal and opposite reaction, though a more metaphorical than physical one. An adventure in Bytopia might challenge characters to recognize the impact their actions have on the world by witnessing the mirrored reactions to their deeds on the opposite layer.\n\n---",
