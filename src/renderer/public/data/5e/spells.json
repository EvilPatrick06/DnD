  {"id":"wish","name":"Wish","level":9,"school":"Conjuration","castingTime":"1 action","range":"Self","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":false,"ritual":false,"description":"Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: create a nonmagical object of up to 25,000 gp in value, grant up to 10 creatures resistance to a chosen damage type, grant up to 10 creatures immunity to a single spell for 8 hours, or undo a single recent event. Using wish for anything other than duplicating a spell carries a risk of never being able to cast wish again.","classes":["sorcerer","wizard"]}
