For all his power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich. A treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna's rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna, all that remained were one eye and one hand, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna's will in the world. The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity. Random Properties: The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have 1 minor beneficial property, 1 major beneficial property, and 1 minor detrimental property. Attuning to the Eye: To attune to the eye, you must press it into your empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. If the eye is ever removed, you die. Properties of the Eye: While you are attuned to the eye, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain Truesight out to 240 feet. Spellcasting: The eye has 8 charges and regains 1d4+4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Eye of Vecna Spells table from the eye (save DC 18). Eye of Vecna Spells: Clairvoyance (2), Crown of Madness (1), Disintegrate (4), Dominate Monster (5), Eyebite (4). X-ray Vision: You can take a Magic action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. Attuning to the Hand: To attune to the hand, you must press it against the stump where your left hand was. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. Properties of the Hand: When you are attuned to the hand, your alignment is Neutral Evil. Great Strength: Your Strength becomes 20 unless it is already 20 or higher. Icy Touch: Any melee spell attack you make with the hand and any melee attack made with a weapon held by it deals an extra 2d8 Cold damage on a hit. Spellcasting: The hand has 8 charges and regains 1d4+4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Hand of Vecna Spells table from the hand (save DC 18). Each time you cast a spell from it, the hand casts Suggestion on you (save DC 18; no Concentration required), demanding that you commit an evil act. Hand of Vecna Spells: Finger of Death (5), Sleep (1), Slow (2), Teleport (3). Properties of the Eye and Hand: While attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits. Danger Sense: You have Advantage on Initiative rolls. Necrotic Reduction: As a Magic action, you can target one creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is transformed into green slime. Poison Immunity: You have Immunity to Poison damage and the Poisoned condition. Regeneration: If you start your turn with at least 1 Hit Point, you regain 1d10 Hit Points. Wish: You can cast Wish. Once used, this property can't be used again until 30 days have passed. Destroying the Eye and Hand: If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.",

    "description": "Weapon (Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, or Shortsword). Requires Attunement by a Creature of the Weapon's Choice. Of all the magic items created by elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a Moonblade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such weapon. Over the centuries, some of these weapons have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Others have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain. Every Moonblade longs for a bearer whose disposition and goals are compatible with its own. If you try to attune to a Moonblade that doesn't want you as its bearer, the weapon not only rejects you but also places a curse on you, causing you to make D20 Tests with Disadvantage for 24 hours or until the curse is ended by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic. If you're accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune appears on the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A Moonblade functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen bearer. A Moonblade has one rune on it for each bearer it has willingly served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the Moonblade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly by rolling on the Moonblade Properties table. Minor Property: In addition to its aforementioned properties, each Moonblade has a minor property determined by rolling on the Magic Item's Minor Property table. Sentience: A Moonblade is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet. Its alignment matches that of its creator. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate through visions or dreams when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. Personality: A Moonblade has a personality similar to that of its creator. Moonblade Properties (d100): 01-60 Increase the weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. 61-75 Extra 1d6 Force damage on hit (increases by 1d6 each time, max 3d6). 76-80 Gains Thrown property (20/60 ft), returns after attack. 81-85 Critical Hit on 19 or 20. 86-95 Bonus Action to flash brightly, DC 15 Con save or Blinded for 1 min (recharges on Short/Long Rest). 96-99 Properties of a Ring of Spell Storing. 00 Conjure a shadowy elf (Shadow stat block, Fey, Neutral alignment).",

When the effect ends, the token disappears.\n\nBird (Rare). You can take a Magic action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.\n\nFan (Uncommon). If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.\n\nSwan Boat (Rare).

The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.\n\nTree (Uncommon). You must be outdoors to use this token.

The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\n\nWhip (Rare).

You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.

If the creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock it down, giving it the Prone condition. Protective Field. As a Reaction, when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot Emanation originating from you. When the Emanation appears, any creatures or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest unoccupied spaces outside it.

A creature or object inside the Emanation can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation damage anything outside it.

On a failed save, the creature dies and, if it is a Humanoid, turns into a Zombie. Magic Weapon. You can wield the wand as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 Necrotic damage on a hit. Random Properties. The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties: 2 minor beneficial properties, 1 major beneficial property, 2 minor detrimental properties, 1 major detrimental property. The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus. Protection. You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand. Spells. The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it (save DC 18): Animate Dead (1 charge), Blight (2 charges), Circle of Death (3 charges), Finger of Death (3 charges), Power Word Kill (4 charges), Speak with Dead (1 charge). While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0). Call Undead. While holding the wand, you can take a Magic action to conjure 15 Skeletons and 15 Zombies. These Undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until the next dawn, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until the next dawn. Sentience. The Wand of Orcus is a sentient Chaotic Evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet. The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Abyssal and Common. Personality. The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. Destroying the Wand. Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life. Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.",
