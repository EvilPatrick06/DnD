  "description": "When you take a Magic action to read this scroll, a particular titan named in the scroll appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. The DM picks a suitable titan or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below (see the *Monster Manual* for the creature's stat block).\n\nThe titan is Hostile toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points. If the titan is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.\n\n| 1d100 | Titan |\n|-------|-------|\n| 01--15 | Animal Lord |\n| 16--30 | Blob of Annihilation |\n| 31--45 | Colossus |\n| 46--60 | Elemental Cataclysm |\n| 61--75 | Empyrean |\n| 76--90 | Kraken (a kraken requires a body of water large enough to contain it, or the summoning fails and the scroll is wasted) |\n| 91--00 | Tarrasque |",
