  "description": "The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the *Book of Exalted Deeds* figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's authors filled the pages with their own visions of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.\n\nThe *Book of Exalted Deeds* rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring hope to an endangered world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.\n\nA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits.\n\nOther creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. A Fiend, an Undead, or a servant of a god from the Lower Planes that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 Radiant damage. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.",
