  "description": "This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. The jug sloshes when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.\n\nYou can take a Magic action and name one liquid from the Alchemy Jug Liquids table to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as a Utilize action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.\n\nOnce the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.\n\n### Alchemy Jug Liquids\n\n| Liquid | Max. Amount | Liquid | Max. Amount |\n|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|\n| Acid | 8 ounces | Oil | 1 quart |\n| Basic Poison | 4 ounces | Vinegar | 2 gallons |\n| Beer | 4 gallons | Water, fresh | 8 gallons |\n| Honey | 1 gallon | Water, salt | 12 gallons |\n| Mayonnaise | 2 gallons | Wine | 1 gallon |",
