  "description": "This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.\n\nThe magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.\n\nAny physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a *Dispel Magic* spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.\n\n### Deck of Illusions\n\n| 1d100 | Illusion* |\n|-------|-----------|\n| 01--03 | Adult Red Dragon |\n| 04--06 | Archmage |\n| 07--09 | Assassin |\n| 10--12 | Bandit Captain |\n| 13--15 | Beholder |\n| 16--18 | Berserker |\n| 19--21 | Bugbear Warrior |\n| 22--24 | Cloud Giant |\n| 25--27 | Druid |\n| 28--30 | Erinyes |\n| 31--33 | Ettin |\n| 34--36 | Fire Giant |\n| 37--39 | Frost Giant |\n| 40--42 | Gnoll Warrior |\n| 43--45 | Goblin Warrior |\n| 46--48 | Guardian Naga |\n| 49--51 | Hill Giant |\n| 52--54 | Hobgoblin Warrior |\n| 55--57 | Incubus |\n| 58--60 | Iron Golem |\n| 61--63 | Knight |\n| 64--66 | Kobold Warrior |\n| 67--69 | Lich |\n| 70--72 | Medusa |\n| 73--75 | Night Hag |\n| 76--78 | Ogre |\n| 79--81 | Oni |\n| 82--84 | Priest |\n| 85--87 | Succubus |\n| 88--90 | Troll |\n| 91--93 | Veteran Warrior |\n| 94--96 | Wyvern |\n| 97--00 | The card drawer |\n\n*Stat blocks for these creatures (except the card drawer) appear in the Monster Manual.*",
