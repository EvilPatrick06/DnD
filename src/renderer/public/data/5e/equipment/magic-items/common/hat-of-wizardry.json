  "description": "This cone-shaped hat is adorned with moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.\n\n**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use the hat as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.\n\n**Unknown Spell.** As a Magic action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a Long Rest.",
