  "description": "This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and summon your choice of a **Bat**, a **Frog**, or a **Rat**. The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is Indifferent toward you and other creatures, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.",
