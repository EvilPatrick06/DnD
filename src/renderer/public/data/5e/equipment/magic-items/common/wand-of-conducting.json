  "description": "This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to 120 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.\n\n**Regaining Charges.** The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.",
