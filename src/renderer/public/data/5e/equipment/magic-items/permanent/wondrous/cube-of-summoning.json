  "description": "This Tiny cube looks like a jack-in-the-box. When you wind its crank as a Magic action, a merry tune emits from the box, the lid pops open, a creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space, and the lid closes. The lid can't otherwise be opened.\n\nRoll on the Cube of Summoning table to determine which spell the cube casts to summon the creature. The spell is cast at level 5 (save DC 17, +9 attack bonus) and doesn't require Concentration, but you otherwise function as the spell's caster.\n\nOnce the cube summons a creature, the cube can't do so again until the next dawn.",
