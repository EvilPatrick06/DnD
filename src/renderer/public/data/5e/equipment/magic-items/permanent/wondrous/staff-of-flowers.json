While holding it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of yourself, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.",
