  "description": "This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use any of its properties:\n\nCast Spell. You can expend 1 of the staff's charges to cast Charm Person, Command, or Comprehend Languages from it using your spell save DC.\n\nReflect Enchantment. If you succeed on a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.\n\nResist Enchantment. If you fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn.\n\nRegaining Charges. The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.",
