Items that come in pairs — such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves — impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either. Full properties are detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide.",
