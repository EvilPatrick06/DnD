  "description": "When you take a Magic action to read this scroll, a particular titan named in the scroll appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. The DM picks a suitable titan or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below (see the *Monster Manual* for the creature's stat block).\n\nThe titan is Hostile toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points. If the titan is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.",
