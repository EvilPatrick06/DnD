  "description": "An Arcane Focus takes one of the forms in the Arcane Focuses table and is bejeweled or carved to channel arcane magic. A Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard can use such an item as a Spellcasting Focus. The Staff form also functions as a Quarterstaff. Note: 'Staff of Power' is a magic item detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide, not in the Player's Handbook Equipment chapter. The closest non-magic staff equipment entry is this Arcane Focus (Staff).",
