You can take a Use action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A Frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.",
