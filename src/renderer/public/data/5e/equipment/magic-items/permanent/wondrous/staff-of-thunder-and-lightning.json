  "description": "This item is not found in the 2024 Player's Handbook Chapter 6: Equipment. It is a magic item detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide. As a legendary staff requiring Attunement, it can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It has the following additional properties, each of which can be used once per dawn. Lightning: When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 Lightning damage. Thunder: When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder audible out to 300 feet; the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be Stunned until the end of your next turn. Lightning Strike: You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning in a 5-foot-wide, 120-foot-long Line; each creature in the Line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Thunderclap: You can cause a thunderclap audible out to 600 feet; each creature within 60 feet of you must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become Stunned until the end of your next turn. Thunder and Lightning: You can use both Lightning Strike and Thunderclap simultaneously.",
