  "description": "This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can take a Magic action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 *Fireball* (save DC 15).\n\nYou can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the *Fireball* by 1d6 for each bead after the first (maximum 12d6).",
