While holding the staff, you can use any of its properties:\n\n**Cast Spell.** You can expend 1 of the staff's charges to cast *Charm Person*, *Command*, or *Comprehend Languages* from it using your spell save DC.\n\n**Reflect Enchantment.** If you succeed on a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.\n\n**Resist Enchantment.** If you fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn.\n\n**Regaining Charges.** The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.",
