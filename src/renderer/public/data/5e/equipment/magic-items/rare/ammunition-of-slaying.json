  "description": "This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the DM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.\n\nAfter dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.\n\n| 1d100 | Creature Type | 1d100 | Creature Type |\n|-------|---------------|-------|---------------|\n| 01--10 | Aberrations | 51--60 | Fey |\n| 11--15 | Beasts | 61--70 | Fiends |\n| 16--20 | Celestials | 71--75 | Giants |\n| 21--25 | Constructs | 76--80 | Monstrosities |\n| 26--35 | Dragons | 81--85 | Oozes |\n| 36--45 | Elementals | 86--90 | Plants |\n| 46--50 | Humanoids | 91--00 | Undead |",
