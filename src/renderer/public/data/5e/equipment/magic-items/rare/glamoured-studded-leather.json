You can also take a Bonus Action to cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like--including color, style, and accessories--but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or doff the armor.",
