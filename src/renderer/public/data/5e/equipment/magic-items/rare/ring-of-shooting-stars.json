  "description": "You can cast *Dancing Lights* or *Light* from the ring.\n\nThe ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.\n\n***Faerie Fire.*** You can expend 1 charge to cast *Faerie Fire* from the ring.\n\n***Lightning Spheres.*** You can expend 2 charges as a Magic action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.\n\nEach sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot radius.\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind Total Cover, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.\n\n| Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage | Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 1 | 4d12 | 3 | 2d6 |\n| 2 | 5d4 | 4 | 2d4 |\n\n***Shooting Stars.*** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a Magic action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.",
