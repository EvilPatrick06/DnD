For 1 charge, you cast the level 3 version of the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.\n\n**Regaining Charges.** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.",
