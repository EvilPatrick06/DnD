  "description": "You can make this carpet hover and fly by taking a Magic action and using the carpet's command word. It moves according to your directions if you are within 30 feet of it.\n\nFour sizes of *Carpet of Flying* exist. The DM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly by rolling on the following table. A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but its Fly Speed is halved if it carries more than its normal capacity.\n\n| 1d100 | Size | Capacity | Fly Speed |\n|-------|------|----------|-----------|\n| 01--20 | 3 ft. x 5 ft. | 200 lb. | 80 feet |\n| 21--55 | 4 ft. x 6 ft. | 400 lb. | 60 feet |\n| 56--80 | 5 ft. x 7 ft. | 600 lb. | 40 feet |\n| 81--00 | 6 ft. x 9 ft. | 800 lb. | 30 feet |",
