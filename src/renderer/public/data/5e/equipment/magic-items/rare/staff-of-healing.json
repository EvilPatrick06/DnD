The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.\n\n| Spell | Charge Cost |\n|-------|-------------|\n| *Cure Wounds* | 1 charge per spell level (maximum 4 for a level 4 spell) |\n| *Lesser Restoration* | 2 |\n| *Mass Cure Wounds* | 5 |\n\n**Regaining Charges.** The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.",
