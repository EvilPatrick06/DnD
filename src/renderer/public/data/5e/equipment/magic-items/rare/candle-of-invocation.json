  "description": "This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a Magic action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.\n\nWhile lit, the candle sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have Advantage on D20 Tests. In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.\n\nAlternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast *Gate* with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the DM or determined by rolling on the following table.\n\n| 1d100 | Outer Plane | 1d100 | Outer Plane |\n|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|\n| 01--05 | Abyss | 55--59 | Gehenna |\n| 06--10 | Acheron | 60--64 | Hades |\n| 11--17 | Arborea | 65--69 | Limbo |\n| 18--25 | Arcadia | 70--77 | Mechanus |\n| 26--33 | Beastlands | 78--85 | Mount Celestia |\n| 34--41 | Bytopia | 86--90 | Nine Hells |\n| 42--46 | Carceri | 91--95 | Pandemonium |\n| 47--54 | Elysium | 96--00 | Ysgard |",
