  "description": "An *Instrument of the Bards* is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. The Instruments of the Bards table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 Psychic damage.\n\nYou can play the instrument to cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.\n\n### Instruments of the Bards\n\n| Instrument | Rarity | Spells |\n|------------|--------|--------|\n| All | -- | *Fly*, *Invisibility*, *Levitate*, *Protection from Evil and Good*, plus the spells listed for the particular instrument |\n| Anstruth harp | Very Rare | *Cure Wounds* (level 5), *Ice Storm*, *Wall of Thorns* |\n| Canaith mandolin | Rare | *Cure Wounds* (level 3), *Dispel Magic*, *Protection from Energy* (Lightning damage only) |\n| Cli lyre | Rare | *Stone Shape*, *Wall of Fire*, *Wind Wall* |\n| Doss lute | Uncommon | *Animal Friendship*, *Protection from Energy* (Fire damage only), *Protection from Poison* |\n| Fochlucan bandore | Uncommon | *Entangle*, *Faerie Fire*, *Shillelagh*, *Speak with Animals* |\n| Mac-Fuirmidh cittern | Uncommon | *Barkskin*, *Cure Wounds*, *Fog Cloud* |\n| Ollamh harp | Legendary | *Confusion*, *Control Weather*, *Fire Storm* |",
