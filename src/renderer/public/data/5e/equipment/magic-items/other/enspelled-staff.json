  "description": "Bound into this staff is a spell of level 8 or lower. The spell is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.\n\nThe level of the spell bound into the staff determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the staff's rarity, as shown in the following table.\n\n| Spell Level | Rarity | Save DC | Attack Bonus |\n|-------------|--------|---------|--------------|\n| Cantrip | Uncommon | 13 | +5 |\n| 1 | Uncommon | 13 | +5 |\n| 2 | Rare | 13 | +5 |\n| 3 | Rare | 15 | +7 |\n| 4 | Very Rare | 15 | +7 |\n| 5 | Very Rare | 17 | +9 |\n| 6 | Legendary | 17 | +9 |\n| 7 | Legendary | 18 | +10 |\n| 8 | Legendary | 18 | +10 |",
