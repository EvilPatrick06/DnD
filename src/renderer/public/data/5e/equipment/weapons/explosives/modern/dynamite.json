  "description": "As an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) Bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A character can also bind sticks of dynamite together so they explode at the same time. Each additional stick increases the damage by 1d6 (maximum 10d6) and the blast radius by 5 feet (maximum 20 feet).",
