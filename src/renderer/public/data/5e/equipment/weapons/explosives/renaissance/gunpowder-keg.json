  "description": "A keg of gunpowder can be rigged with a fuse and set to detonate. When the keg detonates, each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) Fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Setting the fuse takes an action. Once lit, the fuse burns for a number of rounds determined by its length (1 foot per round).",
