  "description": "Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion — and not limited to anger — this Rage is an incarnation of a predator's ferocity, a storm's fury, and a sea's turmoil. Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.",

You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. While active, your Rage follows these rules: Damage Resistance — You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. Rage Damage — When you make an attack using Strength (with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike) and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column. Strength Advantage — You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. No Concentration or Spells — You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells. Duration — The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following: make an attack roll against an enemy, force an enemy to make a saving throw, or take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.
