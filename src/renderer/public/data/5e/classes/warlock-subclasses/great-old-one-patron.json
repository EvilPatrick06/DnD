You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.\n\nThe telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Warlock level.
