When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one attack with a weapon against the attacker as part of this Reaction if the attacker is within your weapon's range.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest."

You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).\n\n**Charismatic.** You are blessed with an otherworldly presence and have Advantage on all Charisma checks.\n\n**Saving Throw Reroll.** If you fail a saving throw, you can take a Reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.\n\n**Unerring Strike.** Once on each of your turns when you make an attack roll with a weapon and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead."
