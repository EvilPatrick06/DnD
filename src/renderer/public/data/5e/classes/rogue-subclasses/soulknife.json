As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since childhood, revealing their full potential only as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out an order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.",

      "description": "You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass. The Soulknife Energy Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you reach certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.\n\n**Psi-Bolstered Knack.** If you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. The die is expended only if the roll then succeeds.\n\n**Psychic Whispers.** You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As a Magic action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required)."
