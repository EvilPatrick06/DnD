It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the Incapacitated condition.\n\nWhen you manifest the Emanation and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the Emanation. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die)."

That creature gains all the benefits of the Emanation and uses your spell save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.\n\nIn addition, you can manifest the Emanation around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one when manifesting it."
