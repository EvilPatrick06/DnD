Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.\n\nThe damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6)."

The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you're a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels' worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest."

You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature's Ward while there.\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself."
