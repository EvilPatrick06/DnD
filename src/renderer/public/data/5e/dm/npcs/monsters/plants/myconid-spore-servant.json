These ambulatory fungal creatures tend to their sanctuaries and avoid becoming embroiled in the conflicts of other creatures. They use specialized spores to communicate, to alert one another to danger, and to defend themselves. When myconids encounter other beings, they use mind-linking spores to allow nearby creatures to telepathically share thoughts. Nevertheless, myconids' goals remain mysterious to most non-fungal creatures.\nMyconid sprouts tend to their fungal homes and watch for trespassers.\nMyconid adults defend their territories and other myconids from invaders.\nSpore servants are corpses that have been overgrown and reanimated by a myconid sovereign's spores. These fungus-infested bodies are extensions of a myconid sovereign and obey its will.\nMyconid sovereigns resemble towering myconid adults with elaborate fungal growths. They direct their lesser kin and see to the health and growth of vast fungal blooms.",
