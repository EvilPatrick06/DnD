They're notoriously stealthy, and foes that venture into their territories often vanish without a trace.\nBugbear stalkers frequently take their victims hostage, relishing opportunities to imprison and terrorize other creatures.\nBugbear warriors serve those who offer them treasure, food, or the chance to hunt challenging prey.",
