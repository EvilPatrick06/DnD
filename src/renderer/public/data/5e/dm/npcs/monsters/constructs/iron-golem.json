Their creators—typically archmages or master artificers—fashion them to serve as tireless sentinels over vaults, temples, and sanctums. Once given a command, an iron golem follows it without question or deviation, interpreting orders with literal precision. When provoked, it unleashes devastating melee attacks and a cloud of poisonous gas that can fell entire groups of invaders.",
