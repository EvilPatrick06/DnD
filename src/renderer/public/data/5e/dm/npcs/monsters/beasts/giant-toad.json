In addition, the target takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the end of each of the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time, and it can't use Bite while it has a swallowed target. If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer Restrained and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the Prone condition."
