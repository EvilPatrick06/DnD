If the burden of immortality overwhelms a lich, its consciousness turns inward as its body rots away. But if its remains are disturbed, a demilich rises. Demiliches usually appear as skulls adorned with gems or arcane sigils.\nDemiliches jealously guard their deathtrap-laden sanctums. The most notorious of these is the Tomb of Horrors, lair of the infamous Acererak.\nThe region containing a demilich's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:\n**Enervating Domain.** Whenever a creature other than the demilich or one of its allies finishes a Long Rest within 1 mile of the lair, the creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have its Hit Point maximum reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a Long Rest outside that area.\n**Travel Ward.** Creatures can't use teleportation or planar travel to enter or exit the lair.\nIf the demilich dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.",
