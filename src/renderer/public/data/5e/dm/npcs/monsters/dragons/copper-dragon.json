They make their lairs in arid, rocky hills and canyons, shaping vast warrens that echo with laughter. Despite their mischievous natures, copper dragons are staunch defenders of freedom, using cunning and trickery to thwart tyrants and bullies. A copper dragon's two breath weapons—a scorching line of acid and a cone of slowing gas—reflect the dragon's dual nature: playful but perilous.",
