Whether their curse is a blessing or a burden depends on the lycanthrope and its bestial nature. Some embrace the power of transformation, while others dread their uncontrollable changes. A lycanthrope's curse can be spread through its bite, potentially creating more of its kind.\n*Changed by the Might of the Bear*\n**Habitat:** Arctic, Forest, Hill; **Treasure:** Relics\nWhen threatened or compelled by magic, werebears shape-shift from their humanoid forms into mighty bears or hybrids of those two forms. They scare off or sabotage those who threaten the wilds, and they frequently aid Fey, druids, or spirits of the wilderness, as many owe their magical nature to such forces. Werebears take the shape of bears common to the regions in which they dwell, with brown and polar bear forms being common.",
