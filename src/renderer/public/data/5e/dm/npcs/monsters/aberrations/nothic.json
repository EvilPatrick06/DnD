Once a wizard or other spellcaster who delved too deeply into arcane knowledge, a nothic is warped by the magic it sought to master. Its single, enormous eye can rot flesh with a glance. Nothics lurk in dark places—ruins, dungeons, and the Underdark—spying on others and hoarding secrets. They are paranoid and territorial but can be bargained with if offered knowledge or magical lore.",
