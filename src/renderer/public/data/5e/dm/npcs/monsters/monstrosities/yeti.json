Covered in thick white fur, they blend seamlessly into snowy terrain, ambushing prey with savage claws and a paralyzing gaze that freezes victims in place. Though cunning hunters, yetis have an instinctive fear of fire, and even a small flame can send one into a panicked retreat. Yetis live in small family groups or alone, sheltering in ice caves and venturing out to hunt during blizzards when their camouflage is most effective.",
