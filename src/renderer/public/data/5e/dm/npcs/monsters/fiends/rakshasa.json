Behind the pleasing exterior lies a cruel, calculating predator with backward-facing hands and the head of a beast—most often a tiger. Slain rakshasas inevitably reform on the Lower Planes and plot their revenge, making them recurring threats across lifetimes. They delight in corrupting others, using charm and deception to turn mortals against one another while savoring their victims' despair.",
