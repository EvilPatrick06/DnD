These serpentine fiends coordinate demonic hordes with terrifying tactical brilliance, and their skill with their six longswords is unmatched among demonkind. Mariliths command through strength and cunning, demanding absolute obedience from lesser demons. They coil their powerful tails around foes while striking with a whirlwind of steel, and they can teleport across the battlefield in the blink of an eye.",
