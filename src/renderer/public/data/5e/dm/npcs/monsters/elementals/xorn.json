  "lore": "Xorns are bizarre elemental creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Earth. They have radially symmetrical, barrel-shaped bodies with three eyes, three arms ending in taloned hands, and a wide mouth atop their heads. Xorns have an insatiable appetite for gems and precious metals, which they can detect by scent. They burrow through earth and stone as easily as a fish swims through water, leaving no tunnel or trace of their passage. While not inherently hostile, xorns can become aggressive when denied the minerals they crave.",
