They dwell in enchanted forests and the Feywild, where they delight in playing pranks and tricks on travelers. Despite their mischief, faerie dragons are generally good-natured and can be valuable allies. Their scales shift in color as they age, cycling through the hues of the rainbow. Faerie dragons are drawn to areas of natural beauty and strong connections to the Feywild, where they guard ancient groves and hidden glens.",
