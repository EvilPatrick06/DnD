  "lore": "A displacer beast resembles a lithe, six-legged panther with two muscular tentacles growing from its shoulders. Each tentacle ends in a pad of barbed flesh. The creature's most fearsome trait is its ability to bend light, projecting a magical illusion that makes it appear to be standing a short distance from its actual position. Displacer beasts are cunning predators that lurk in dark forests and subterranean passages, hunting prey with pack-like coordination.",
