  "lore": "*Dragon of Courage and Fairness*\n**Habitat:** Mountain, Urban; **Treasure:** Arcana\nSilver dragons work to preserve peace and encourage greatness. They try to live as examples of decency while remaining watchful against evil.\nSilver dragons typically dwell amid snow-capped mountains, though aspirations and congeniality drive some to instead live among cosmopolitan societies. Disguised as humanoids, they ally with artists, historians, knights, and humble leaders who learn from the past to create better futures.\nSilver dragons take inspiration from legendary heroes and have grand ambitions. Many collect treasures that reflect these interests, such as histories, ancient art, and the gear of famous champions.\nSilver dragon wyrmlings typically live with one or more parents or mentors, learning much about the world and its past before living on their own.\nYoung silver dragons usually have close ties with elder metallic dragons or heroic role models, helping those with great goals achieve their ambitions. They might serve as messengers for or representatives of such do-gooders.\nAdult silver dragons love to spend time among various peoples. Rather than manipulating politics directly, they support individuals who have ambitious goals or who popularize the return of great universities, inspiring athletics events or festivals, and other salutary civic institutions of the past. Silver dragons often surround themselves with like-minded allies and are watchful for hidden threats.\nAncient silver dragons pursue world-wide change. They defend their communities and allies, encouraging them to perform deeds worthy of legend. Some set their sights on other worlds and planes of existence, creating extraplanar alliances or combating multiplanar threats. They might have guises in multiple societies and forge generation-spanning friendships with heroic families or valorous groups.\n> ### Silver Dragon Lairs\n>\n> Silver dragons typically lair in picturesque mountain retreats or on sculpted cloud \"islands.\"\n>\n> The region containing an adult or ancient silver dragon's lair is changed by its magic, creating the following effects:\n>\n> ***Gentle Gusts.*** Winds buoy creatures that fall within 1 mile of the lair. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling.\n>\n> ***Sun and Storms.*** While in its lair, the dragon can cast *Control Weather*, requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action.\n>\n> If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.",
