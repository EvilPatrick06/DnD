To create grimlocks, illithids capture Humanoids, expose them to strange forms of Underdark radiation, and implant new directives into their brains. The process of creating a grimlock rends the creature's mind such that no semblance of the individual's former personality remains.\nGrimlocks have shallow depressions rather than eyes. A sixth sense allows grimlocks to perceive their surroundings. Psychic energies from their transformations linger in grimlocks' bodies, and they channel these eerie forces into their attacks.\nRoll on or choose a result from the Grimlock Tasks table to inspire how grimlocks serve illithids.\n> \"We thought we'd discovered a new people living deeper than we believed possible. The truth was something far worse.\" -- Aljayera, Underdark Seer",
