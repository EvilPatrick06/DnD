If destroyed, a gas spore explodes in a poisonous burst that can infect creatures and slay them in hours. Infected corpses spawn more gas spores that grow to full size in a matter of days.\nIf exposed to light or otherwise disturbed, mushroomlike shriekers emit a high-pitched noise that gives them their name. This wailing might alert other creatures or attract predators.\nSlow but mobile, violet fungi rot any flesh they touch with their lashing tendrils.\nA violet fungus necrohulk forms when a violet fungus colony infests and animates an ample heap of decay. This necrohulk attacks prey and spreads fungal spores for the colony.",
