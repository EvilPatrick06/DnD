Different groups of thri-kreen have distinct carapaces, from the rocky shades of desert-dwellers to the vibrant hues of those living in verdant lands. While their language has a distinctly insectile quality, thri-kreen often use telepathy to communicate, and groups can rapidly share a wealth of detailed information without making a sound.\n> \"I would tell you now the tale of the first Ka'Cha, the first thri-kreen who knew and taught the truth: that the clutch is all.\" -- Ka'Cha, Thri-kreen Knowledge Hunter\nThri-kreen marauders employ weapons made of stone and bone, such as the spear-like gythka and throwing blades called chatkcha.\nThri-kreen psions harness their psychic powers to avoid danger and manipulate objects from afar.",
