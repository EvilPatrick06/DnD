They petrify those they bite, their slightest peck turning their prey to stone.\nCockatrices often try to claim eye-catching structures--such as ruins and secluded farms--as roosts.\nBolder than their smaller cousins, cockatrice regents brim with unstable magical energy they use to restrain distant foes.",
