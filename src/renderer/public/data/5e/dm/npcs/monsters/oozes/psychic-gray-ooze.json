Magic-users who fail in their attempts to bind elemental spirits to the bodies of Constructs might also accidentally create gray oozes.\nPsychic gray oozes exhibit violent psionic abilities. These oozes sometimes result from failed attempts to summon or create creatures linked to the Elemental Plane of Earth, like gargoyles or homunculi.",
