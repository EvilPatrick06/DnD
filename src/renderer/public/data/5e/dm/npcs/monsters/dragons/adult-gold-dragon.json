  "lore": "*Dragon of Hope and Majesty*\n**Habitat:** Forest, Grassland; **Treasure:** Arcana\nGold dragons work to make the world a better place. The most powerful of the metallic dragons, these awe-inspiring dragons strive to protect that which is good and bend fate toward a brighter future. Their kind dispositions don't prevent gold dragons from engaging in combat when necessary, though, and they exhale brilliant flames and weakening magic to rout their foes.\nGold dragons favor grasslands and pristine forests, frequently dwelling near awe-inspiring natural wonders or guarding monuments from ancient civilizations. In their lairs, gold dragons hoard coins and gems, but they frequently put their treasure to use in pursuit of greater goals. They often use their riches to buy rare lore books, pay informants, or patronize idealistic adventurers.\nGold dragon wyrmlings learn much from their elders, then head off to save the world. Idealistic and curious, these wyrmlings seek to right obvious wrongs and make friends among those they aid.\nYoung gold dragons have seen glimpses of the world's true evils and crusade to oppose them. They often seek bold and direct solutions to problems.\nAdult gold dragons act subtly, frequently changing their shape to resemble harmless animals or cultivating personas so they can pass as common people.\nAncient gold dragons are wise and mysterious. Many aid virtuous groups, guiding them in secret or patronizing them from afar. Only when stakes are at their highest do ancient gold dragons reveal themselves in all their majesty.\n> ### Gold Dragon Lairs\n>\n> Gold dragons make their homes in places of natural and magical wonder.\n>\n> The region containing an adult or ancient gold dragon's lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:\n>\n> ***Dream Messenger.*** While in its lair, the dragon can cast *Dream*, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability. When casting the spell this way, the dragon can target any creature within 6 miles.\n>\n> ***Foretelling Fog.*** The area within 1 mile of the lair is Lightly Obscured by opalescent fog. While in that area, creatures can't be surprised, as the fog swirls into shapes that warn of danger.\n>\n> If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.",
