Standing tall with bark-covered bodies and limbs like gnarled branches, they are slow to anger but terrible in their wrath. Treants speak in deep, rumbling voices and view themselves as guardians of their woodland homes. They command lesser trees to rise up and fight alongside them, and they hurl great rocks at those who would despoil the wilds. When motionless, a treant is nearly indistinguishable from a normal tree.",
