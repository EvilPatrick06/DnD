A green hag's illusory appearance conceals a withered, moss-green frame with long, gnarled claws. These hags delight in manipulating and corrupting others, often preying on the desperate and the vain. They mimic the sounds of the forest to lure victims to their doom. Like other hags, green hags sometimes form covens with other hags to amplify their magical power.",

For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching it would feel its rough features.
