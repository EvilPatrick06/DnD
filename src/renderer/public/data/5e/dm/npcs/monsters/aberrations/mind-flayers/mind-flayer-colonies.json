They feed on the brains of sentient creatures, using their tentacles to extract the brains of helpless prey. Mind flayers communicate via telepathy and use their formidable psionic powers to dominate and enslave other creatures, bending them to serve the colony's alien purposes. A colony's elder brain resides in a briny pool at the colony's heart, where it telepathically coordinates the machinations of its mind flayer thralls.",
