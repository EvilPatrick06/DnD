It lurks in dungeons and other dark places, waiting for unsuspecting creatures to touch it so it can feed. A mimic's adhesive surface holds victims in place while its pseudopods batter them and its maw devours them. Some mimics develop the ability to communicate in rudimentary fashion, luring prey with false promises of treasure.",
