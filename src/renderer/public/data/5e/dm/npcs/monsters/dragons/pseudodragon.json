  "lore": "A pseudodragon is a cat-sized dragon with a pointed tail that it uses to inject venom. Despite its small stature, it possesses a sharp mind and a playful, sometimes mischievous personality. A pseudodragon communicates through limited telepathy, projecting simple ideas, emotions, and images to nearby creatures. Pseudodragons are prized as companions by mages and adventurers alike, though they choose their own partners and can be difficult to win over. Those that form bonds are fiercely loyal to their chosen companions.",
