They consume organic waste and carrion, sometimes forming a symbiotic relationship with creatures that produce such refuse. Despite their repulsive appearance, otyughs are intelligent enough to bargain with other creatures, offering to clean up waste in exchange for fresh meat. They communicate through limited telepathy, projecting images and simple ideas into the minds of nearby creatures.",
