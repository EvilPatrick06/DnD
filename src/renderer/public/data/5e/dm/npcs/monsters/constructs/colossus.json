Standing dozens of feet tall, these awe-inspiring automatons are built by mighty spellcasters or civilizations at the height of their power. A colossus might serve as a guardian of a city, a weapon of war, or the lasting monument of a forgotten empire. When its creator perishes or the magic sustaining it fades, a colossus might continue to follow its last commands for centuries, patrolling ruins long after the civilization that built it has crumbled to dust.",
