These gaunt, animate cadavers with unnaturally long tongues dwell in catacombs and ruins where they devour the contents of graves and paralyze foes with vicious claws.\nGhouls rise from the bodies of cannibals and villains with depraved hungers. They form packs out of shared voracity.\nLacedons are loose-skinned, aquatic ghouls. They often arise from the corpses of greedy pirates, those who starved on deserted islands, or scoundrels who met their end by drowning.\n> *On a plain of teeth, in a temple of filth, the starving king wastes no morsel. Every coffin a banquet. Every slab a platter. Now is the time of feasting!*\n>\n> -- Invocation of Doresain, King of Ghouls",
