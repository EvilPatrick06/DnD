They frequently observe battles from a distance, sometimes shapeshifting into Humanoid form to walk among soldiers and study military strategy. Among the most interventionist of metallic dragons, bronze dragons willingly take up arms against tyranny, evil navies, and marauding sea creatures. Their lairs are found along rocky coastlines, within sea caves, or amid the ruins of sunken ships.",
