It is bound to an enchanted amulet; whoever wears the amulet commands the guardian. These tireless sentinels are prized by wizards and other spellcasters for their ability to absorb damage meant for their masters and store spells for later use. Without a master, a shield guardian stands motionless where it was last commanded, patiently awaiting instructions that may never come.",
