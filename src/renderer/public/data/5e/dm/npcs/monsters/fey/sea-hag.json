On a failed save, the creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with Disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours. Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has Disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag."
