These misshapen demons have distorted features and bodies that crawl with Abyssal parasites. Overwhelmed by demonic urges and constant terror, manes know only shock and frenzied outbursts.\nManes lash out at creatures that appear weaker than themselves -- or that react to them with fear -- and strive to avoid more powerful demons. When manes escape from the Abyss, they go on reckless rampages and inflict as much harm as possible.\nVaporspawn arise from evil souls shattered by unspeakable torments or the depredations of more powerful demons. These distorted manes undergo endless, painful contortions, and they share their torment with whatever creatures they encounter.",
