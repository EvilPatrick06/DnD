Found in the most frigid arctic environments, these burrowing monstrosities tunnel through glaciers and frozen earth to ambush prey. The searing heat within their bodies is so intense that it can melt weapons and burn creatures that strike them in melee. Despite their terrifying power, remorhazes are driven primarily by hunger, attacking anything they perceive as food. Treasures from consumed victims can sometimes be found in a remorhaz's gizzard or lair.",
