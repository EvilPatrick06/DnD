  "lore": "Animal Lords are powerful Fey beings who embody the primal essence of a particular type of animal. Each Animal Lord serves as a divine guardian and sovereign over its chosen species, dwelling where its animals roam and fiercely protecting them from unnatural threats. In their true forms, Animal Lords appear as imposing humanoid figures bearing unmistakable features of their animal kin. They can assume the shape of a Beast at will and communicate effortlessly with animals. Druids, rangers, and other nature-devoted folk sometimes seek the aid of an Animal Lord, though earning one's favor often requires proving dedication to the natural world.",
