  "lore": "*Power-Hungry Serpentine Conspirators*\n**Habitat:** Desert, Forest, Swamp, Urban; **Treasure:** Relics\nExploiting pacts with sinister supernatural forces, yuan-ti bargain away their humanity for the lethality and predatory deviousness of serpents. From hidden bastions, they manipulate rulers and the wealthy, seeking to control the world. Many yuan-ti possess venomous magic, which often manifests as fangs or striking serpents.\nYuan-ti have humanlike forms with a variety of horrifying serpentine transformations. Some have a scattering of reptilian scales, while others are giants that are more snake than human. Typically, the more snakelike yuan-ti are, the greater esteem they hold among their kind.\nYuan-ti might gain their reptilian features through dangerous supernatural rites. Roll on or choose a result from the Yuan-ti Transformations table to inspire how yuan-ti obtain their serpentine aspects.\nInfiltrators can pass as human, their serpentine features limited to scaly skin, forked tongues, and other minor or internal transformations. These spies insinuate themselves among their rivals, manipulating others and making foes vulnerable to the plots of more powerful yuan-ti.\nMalisons exhibit snakelike features that make them deadly in combat. Three general types exist:\n**Type 1.** These malisons have human bodies and the heads of giant, venomous snakes.\n**Type 2.** These malisons have human bodies, but they've replaced their arms with snakes.\n**Type 3.** These malisons are human from the waist up, but below that extend the coils of a giant snake.\nMalisons possess deadly venom, which some manipulate into magical strikes. They can also shape-shift into snakes, helping them to position themselves for surprise attacks or to slither away with nary a trace.\nYuan-ti abominations have traded away nearly all evidence of their humanity, coming to resemble giant, upright serpents with scaly arms and hands. In battle, they relish opportunities to crush foes in their powerful coils or strike with their venomous fangs. These abominations can also shape-shift into snakes. In these forms, abominations are indistinguishable from normal serpents.\nThe true threat of yuan-ti abominations stems not from their physical might but from their cunning. These masterminds often lead cultlike cells of other yuan-ti and direct them in enacting elaborate conspiracies. Abominations avoid jeopardizing themselves, typically scheming from hidden bastions where they're protected by yuan-ti and serpent guardians. These coldhearted leaders have a unique understanding of the supernatural forces that grant yuan-ti their powers, and they usually have insidious magical traps and contingencies at their disposal.\n> \"Great magic, twisted and corrupted ... Malice beyond reckoning ... Flesh reshaped, becoming serpentine horrors ...\" -- Last Message of Sorril Venil, Explorer of the Labyrinth of Madness",
