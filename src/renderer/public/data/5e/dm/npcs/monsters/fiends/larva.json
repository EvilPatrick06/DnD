These pathetic creatures are nearly helpless and struggle to escape the attention of the more powerful inhabitants of the Lower Planes. Many Fiends view larvae as delicacies to be consumed, while evil magic-users find larvae useful for depraved rituals. Night hags frequently collect and herd larvae, trading them to nefarious parties across the multiverse.\nLarvae that survive on the Lower Planes long enough can eventually transform into other sorts of lesser Fiends.\nLarvae have disjointed, painful memories of their past lives. Most desperately avoid other creatures.",
