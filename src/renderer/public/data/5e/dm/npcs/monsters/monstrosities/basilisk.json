On a failed save, the creature has the Restrained condition as it begins to turn to stone. The Restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming Petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the Greater Restoration spell or other magic.\n\nIf a creature that isn't Surprised starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk, the creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\n\nIf the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, the basilisk mistakes it for a rival and targets itself with its gaze."
