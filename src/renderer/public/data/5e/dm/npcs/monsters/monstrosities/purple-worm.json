They mindlessly consume anything in their path—earth, stone, and creature alike—leaving behind vast tunnels that reshape the underground landscape. Entire civilizations have risen and fallen in the winding warrens these worms leave behind. When a purple worm detects vibrations from nearby creatures, it erupts from stone to swallow its prey whole, dissolving victims in its gullet.",
