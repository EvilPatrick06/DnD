Once proud soldiers, knights, or other martial figures, they were animated by necromantic energy or a curse and now haunt ruins and tombs, guarding ancient treasures or enacting the will of dark masters. Wights retain fragments of their former intelligence and can command lesser undead, particularly zombies they create with their life-draining touch. They shun sunlight but are relentless in darkness, leading packs of undead in raids against the living.",
