  "lore": "Half dragons are Humanoids infused with draconic power, often the result of a dragon's magical blessing, a pact, or an ancient ritual. They bear visible signs of their draconic heritage—scales, slitted pupils, or vestigial horns—and can unleash a devastating breath weapon akin to that of a true dragon. Half dragons are proud warriors who gravitate toward martial pursuits, serving as champions, enforcers, or lone wanderers seeking to prove their draconic might.",
