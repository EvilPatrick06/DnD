    "incubation": "1d4 days",
    "symptoms": "Random fits of uncontrollable laughter that incapacitate the infected creature",
    "effect": "After the incubation period, the infected creature gains 1 level of Exhaustion. While Exhausted, any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Psychic damage and is Incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter on a success. Any Humanoid creature that starts its turn within a 10-foot Emanation of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease.",
    "mechanicalEffect": "1 Exhaustion level gained. Stress triggers DC 13 CON save or 1d10 Psychic damage + Incapacitated (mad laughter) for 1 minute. Contagious: DC 10 CON within 10-ft Emanation.",
