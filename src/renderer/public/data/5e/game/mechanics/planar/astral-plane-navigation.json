  "description": "Rules governing movement and navigation within the Astral Plane. Travelers move by thinking about moving; distance has little meaning outside of combat. In combat, a creature's Fly Speed in feet equals 5 times its Intelligence score, and it can hover. To find a destination within the Astral Plane or Wildspace, a creature need only think about it, which makes the creature aware of the most direct route to that location. The creature does not know how long the journey will take or how perilous it will be, only which direction to go. The DM decides travel time: a trek to a specific location (such as a particular Wildspace system or Astral outpost) might take 4d6 days; a more general location (such as a color pool leading to a specified plane) might take 1d4 × 10 hours. Creatures on the Astral Plane don't age or suffer from hunger or thirst. Psychic winds can divert, delay, or redirect travelers, and inflict psychic effects on individuals who fail a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. Color pools—two-dimensional pools of rippling color 1d6 × 10 feet in diameter—serve as gateways to other planes, identifiable by their color.",

  "flavorText": "The Astral Plane is a great silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light—the distant stars of far-flung Wildspace systems.",
  "rulesAsWritten": "A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply thinking about moving, but distance has little meaning. In combat, though, a creature has a Fly Speed (in feet) equal to 5 times its Intelligence score and can hover. Just as movement is accomplished by the power of thought, all that is required to find one's destination is to think about it. As long as the destination is somewhere in the Astral Plane (or in Wildspace)—such as 'the nearest githyanki outpost,' 'the nearest color pool leading to the Abyss,' or 'the Wildspace system of Realmspace'—thinking about a place makes the creature aware of the most direct route to that location. The creature doesn't know how long the journey will take or how perilous it will be, just which direction to go in. The DM decides how long it takes to get to a desired destination. A trek to a specific location—a particular Wildspace system or Astral outpost, for example—might take 4d6 days. For a more general location, such as a color pool leading to a specified plane, the journey might take 1d4 × 10 hours.",
