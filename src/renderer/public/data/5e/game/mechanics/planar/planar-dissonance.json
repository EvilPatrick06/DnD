The Upper Planes are: Mount Celestia, Bytopia, Elysium, Beastlands, Arborea, Arcadia, and Ysgard. The Lower Planes are: Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, Pandemonium, the Nine Hells, and Acheron. Planes with neutral alignments (Outlands, Mechanus, Limbo) are neither Upper nor Lower Planes and do not trigger this effect. The cumulative nature means prolonged stays become increasingly debilitating, as 1d4 is added per failure. There is no stated maximum number of cumulative penalties.",
