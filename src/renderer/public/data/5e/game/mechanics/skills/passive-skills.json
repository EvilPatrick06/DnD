  "description": "A Passive Skill score represents the result of an Ability Check that is made without rolling a d20. It reflects a creature's baseline, always-on competency in a given skill or ability. The game refers to a Passive Skill score as a passive check. The formula is: 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check. If the creature has Advantage on the check, add 5. If the creature has Disadvantage on the check, subtract 5. The most common passive check is Passive Perception, which the DM uses to determine whether a creature notices something without actively searching.",
  "shortDescription": "A passive check equals 10 + all applicable modifiers, replacing the d20 roll. Add 5 for Advantage, subtract 5 for Disadvantage.",
  "rulesAsWritten": "A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice. Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check: 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check. If the character has Advantage on the check, add 5. If the character has Disadvantage, subtract 5.",
