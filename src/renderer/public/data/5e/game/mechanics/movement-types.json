  "description": "Every creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet the creature can cover when it moves on its turn. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. A creature may have one or more of the following movement types: Walking (the default), Climbing, Flying, Swimming, and Burrowing. If a creature has more than one movement type, it chooses which to use each time it moves during its turn, and it can switch between types during its move. Whenever a creature switches movement types, subtract the distance already moved from the new Speed. The result determines how much farther the creature can move. If the result is 0 or less, the creature can't use the new Speed during the current move.",
  "shortDescription": "Creatures can have Walking, Climbing, Flying, Swimming, or Burrowing speeds, each governing how far they can move using that mode.",
  "rulesAsWritten": "A creature has one or more of the following speeds: Walking (default), Climb Speed, Fly Speed, Swim Speed, and Burrow Speed. Without a given speed, a creature can still attempt certain movement but at extra cost. Climbing and swimming without the respective speed costs 1 extra foot per foot moved. A flying creature that is knocked Prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is deprived of the ability to move, falls unless it can hover. Burrowing does not leave a usable tunnel unless stated otherwise.",
