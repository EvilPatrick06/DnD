The recruitment costs no money. You can't issue the Recruit order to this facility if it's fully occupied.\n\nKeep track of the Bastion Defenders housed in each of your Barracks. If you lose Bastion Defenders, deduct them from your roster.

A Vast Barrack can accommodate up to twenty-five Bastion Defenders.\n\n---",
