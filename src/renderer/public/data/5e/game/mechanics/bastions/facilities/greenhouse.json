  "description": "*Level 9 Bastion Facility*\n\n**Prerequisite:** None\n**Space:** Roomy\n**Hirelings:** 1\n**Order:** Harvest\n\nA Greenhouse is an enclosure where rare plants and fungi are nurtured in a controlled climate.\n\n***Fruit of Restoration.*** One plant in your Greenhouse has three magical fruits growing on it. Any creature that eats one of these fruits gains the benefit of a *Lesser Restoration* spell. Fruits that aren't eaten within 24 hours of being picked lose their magic. The plant replaces all picked fruits daily at dawn, and it can't be transplanted without killing it.\n\n***Harvest Options.*** When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, choose one of the following options:\n\n**Harvest: Healing Herbs.** You commission the facility's hireling to create a *Potion of Healing (Greater)* made from healing herbs. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.\n\n**Harvest: Poison.** You commission the facility's hireling to extract one application of a poison from rare plants or fungi. Choose the type of poison from the following options: Assassin's Blood, Malice, Pale Tincture, or Truth Serum. See \"Poison\" in chapter 3 for each poison's effect. Once harvested, the poison can be contained in a vial. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.\n\n---",
