The next time you roll for a Bastion event, you can roll twice and choose either result.\n\n***Fortify Self.*** You can meditate in this facility over a period of 7 days. If you leave the Bastion during this time, you gain no benefit.

Re-roll if you get a duplicate result.\n\n| 1d6 | Saving Throw | 1d6 | Saving Throw |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Strength | 4 | Intelligence |\n| 2 | Dexterity | 5 | Wisdom |\n| 3 | Constitution | 6 | Charisma |\n\n---",
