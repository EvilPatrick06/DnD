  "description": "*Level 17 Bastion Facility*\n\n**Prerequisite:** Ability to use an Arcane Focus or a tool as a Spellcasting Focus\n**Space:** Vast\n**Hirelings:** 1\n**Order:** Empower\n\nA door up to 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall appears on a flat, solid surface in one of the other facilities in your Bastion. You choose the location. If you are in your Bastion during a Bastion turn, you can relocate this door to another facility in your Bastion.\n\nOnly you and your Bastion's hirelings can open the door, which leads to a Demiplane that takes the form of a stone room. The Demiplane exists in an extradimensional space and therefore isn't attached physically to other locations in your Bastion. Neither the Demiplane nor its door can be dispelled.\n\n***Empower: Arcane Resilience.*** When you issue the Empower order to this facility, magical runes appear on the Demiplane's walls and last for 7 days. Until the runes disappear, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to five times your level after spending an entire Long Rest in the Demiplane.\n\n***Fabrication.*** While in the Demiplane, you can take a Magic action to create a nonmagical object of your choice from nothing, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space in the Demiplane. The object can be no bigger than 5 feet in any dimension; can't have a value over 5 GP; and must be made of wood, stone, clay, porcelain, glass, paper, nonprecious crystal, or nonprecious metal. You must finish a Long Rest before you can take this action again.\n\n---",
