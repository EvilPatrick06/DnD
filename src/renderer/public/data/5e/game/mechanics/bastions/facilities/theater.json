  "description": "*Level 9 Bastion Facility*\n\n**Prerequisite:** None\n**Space:** Vast\n**Hirelings:** 4\n**Order:** Empower\n\nThe Theater contains a stage, a backstage area where props and sets are kept, and a seating area for a small audience.\n\n***Empower: Theatrical Event.*** When you issue the Empower order to this facility, its hirelings begin work on a theatrical production or concert. Rehearsals and other preparations take 14 days, followed by at least 7 days of performances. The performances can continue indefinitely until a new production gets underway.\n\nYou or another character can contribute to a production in the following ways:\n\n**Composer/Writer.** A character can compose music or write a script for a concert or production that hasn't started rehearsals yet. This effort takes 14 days.\n\n**Conductor/Director.** A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the production can serve as the concert's conductor or the production's director.\n\n**Performer.** A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the rehearsal period can be a star performer in one or more of the performances; one of the Theater's hirelings can serve as an understudy for additional performances.\n\nAt the end of a rehearsal period, each character who contributed to the concert or production can make a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check. If more of these checks succeed than fail, you and any other character who contributed to the concert or production each gain a Theater die, a d6. This die changes to a d8 when you reach level 13 and a d10 when you reach level 17. At any point after the rehearsals end, a character can expend their Theater die to roll it and add the number rolled to one D20 Test they make, immediately after rolling the d20. If a character hasn't expended their Theater die before gaining another, their first die is lost.\n\n---",
