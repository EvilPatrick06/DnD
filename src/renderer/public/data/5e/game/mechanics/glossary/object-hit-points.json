If you carry weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your Speed drops to 5 feet.

When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.\n**Frightened.** A Frightened creature has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n**Grappled.** A Grappled creature's Speed is 0 and can't increase.

Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. The creature types are: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, and Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways.\n**Critical Hit.** If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a Critical Hit. When you score a Critical Hit, you roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal.\n**D20 Test.** Any time a character or monster attempts something that has a chance of failure, it makes a D20 Test by rolling a d20 and adding any applicable modifiers. The three types are ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.\n**Damage.** Damage represents harm caused by attacks, spells, and other effects. It reduces Hit Points.",
