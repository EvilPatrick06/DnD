  "description": "If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a Critical Hit. When you score a Critical Hit, you roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal.",
