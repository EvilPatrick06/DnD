  "description": "Some magic items require a creature to form a bond — called Attunement — with them before the creature can use the item's magical properties. A creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Attuning to an item requires a Short Rest focused on only that item while in physical contact with it. An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time.",
