  "description": "A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime — at least 8 hours — during which you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity. You can't benefit from more than one Long Rest in a 24-hour period. At the end of a Long Rest, you regain all lost Hit Points and spent Hit Point Dice (up to a number equal to half your total Hit Dice, minimum of one die).",
