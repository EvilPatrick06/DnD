  "description": "When a creature takes damage equal to or greater than half its Hit Point Maximum from a single source of damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect from the System Shock table. This rule makes large hits more dangerous and creates dramatic combat moments.",

    "onSuccess": "No additional effect beyond the damage taken",

    "limitations": [
      "The threshold is half the creature's Hit Point Maximum, not half its current Hit Points",
      "Each instance of damage is evaluated separately; multiple smaller hits do not combine to trigger this rule",
      "Creatures immune to the Stunned condition are still affected by other results on the table"
    ]
  },
  "interactions": [
    "High-damage single-hit attacks (such as Disintegrate, critical hits with Sneak Attack, or falling from great heights) are the most common triggers",
    "Creatures with low HP maximums (e.g., commoners, low-CR creatures) will trigger this frequently, adding lethality to encounters",
    "The Stunned condition from result 2-3 is extremely punishing as it causes auto-failed Strength and Dexterity saves and grants Advantage to attackers",
    "Constitution saving throw proficiency and high Constitution scores make characters more resilient against this rule",
    "This interacts with the Relentless Endurance trait (half-orcs) which can prevent the drop to 0 HP from result 1"
