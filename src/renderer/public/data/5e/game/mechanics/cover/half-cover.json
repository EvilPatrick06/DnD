  "description": "A target has Half Cover when another creature or an object covers at least half of the target. Half Cover grants a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives Half Cover and a tree trunk that gives Three-Quarters Cover, the target has Three-Quarters Cover, not both.",
