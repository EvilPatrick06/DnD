  "description": "Appendix A: Lore Glossary of the 2024 Player's Handbook does not contain discrete mechanical rules for Encounter Building. The appendix provides brief narrative and lore descriptions of famous heroes, villains, creatures, locations, and materials referenced throughout the D&D multiverse. While many entries reference adventuring parties (e.g., the Companions of the Hall, Heroes of the Lance, Valor's Call, the Fallbacks, the Company of Seven), dangerous locations (e.g., Castle Ravenloft, Undermountain, Tomb of Horrors), and formidable foes (e.g., Acererak, Strahd von Zarovich, Vecna, Tiamat), no structured encounter-building mechanics, challenge rating tables, XP budgets, or difficulty thresholds are defined in this section. Encounter Building rules are detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide.",

  "dmNotes": "The Lore Glossary in Appendix A serves as a narrative reference for DMs and players. While it does not prescribe encounter-building mechanics, its entries are valuable for encounter flavor, adventure hooks, and NPC/villain motivations. Notable adversaries catalogued include: Acererak (lich, trap-laden dungeons), Strahd von Zarovich (vampire lord of Barovia), Vecna (demigod of secrets), Tiamat (primordial dragon god of greed), Szass Tam (lich necromancer), Iuz (cambion conqueror), Keraptis (archmage of White Plume Mountain), Zargon (Elder Evil), and the League of Malevolence (villain party). Adventuring party templates referenced include the Companions of the Hall, Heroes of the Lance, Heroes of the Realm, Valor's Call, the Fallbacks, and the Company of Seven. Detailed encounter-building rules (XP budgets, CR calculations, difficulty thresholds) are found in the 2024 Dungeon Master's Guide.",
