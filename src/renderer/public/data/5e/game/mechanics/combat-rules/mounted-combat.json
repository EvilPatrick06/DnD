Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your Speed. While mounted, you can either control the mount or allow it to act independently.",

The mount must be willing and at least one size larger than you. While mounted, you can control the mount (it acts on your turn with only Dash, Disengage, or Dodge) or allow it to act independently. If an effect moves the mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing Prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked Prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw. If your mount is knocked Prone, you can use your Reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall Prone in a space within 5 feet of it.",
