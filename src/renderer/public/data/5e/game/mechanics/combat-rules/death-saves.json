  "description": "When a creature starts its turn with 0 Hit Points, it must make a Death Saving Throw—a special saving throw not tied to any ability score, with a DC of 10. Three accumulated successes result in stabilization; three accumulated failures result in death. A natural 1 counts as two failures, and a natural 20 causes the creature to regain 1 Hit Point. Taking damage at 0 Hit Points causes automatic failures, and damage equaling or exceeding the creature's Hit Point maximum causes instant death.",
  "shortDescription": "A DC 10 special save made at the start of each turn while at 0 HP. Three successes stabilize; three failures kill.",
  "rulesAsWritten": "When you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, you must make a special saving throw, called a Death Saving Throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or cling to life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to an ability score. Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. On your third success, you become Stable. On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any Hit Points or become Stable. When you make a Death Saving Throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point. If you take any damage while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Saving Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.",
