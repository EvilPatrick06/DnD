  "description": "A creature that falls takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands with the Prone condition unless it avoids taking damage from the fall. A flying creature that has the Incapacitated or Prone condition or has its Speed reduced to 0 falls unless it can hover. A creature falls 500 feet instantly. If a creature starts falling and its fall doesn't end during the same turn, the creature falls 500 feet at the start of each of its subsequent turns. A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its Reaction to make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to enter the water gracefully. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.",
