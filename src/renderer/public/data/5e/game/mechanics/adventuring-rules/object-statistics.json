  "description": "When time and specificity matter, objects use statistics just like creatures do. Objects have Armor Class (determined by the substance they are made of), Hit Points (determined by their size and resilience—Fragile or Resilient), damage immunities, condition immunities, and automatic saving throw outcomes. An object that drops to 0 Hit Points is destroyed. Objects cannot take actions or act on their own unless animated by magic.",
  "shortDescription": "Rules governing Armor Class, Hit Points, immunities, and saving throws for objects in D&D 2024.",
  "rulesAsWritten": "An object's Armor Class is determined by the material it is made of. A substance's AC is as follows: Cloth/Paper/Rope 11, Crystal/Glass/Ice 13, Wood/Bone 15, Stone 17, Iron/Steel 19, Mithral 21, Adamantine 23. An object's Hit Points are determined by its size and resilience (Fragile or Resilient). Tiny: 2 (Fragile) / 5 (Resilient); Small: 3 (Fragile) / 10 (Resilient); Medium: 4 (Fragile) / 18 (Resilient); Large: 5 (Fragile) / 27 (Resilient); Huge: 10 (Fragile) / 36 (Resilient); Gargantuan: 20 (Fragile) / 50 (Resilient). Objects are immune to Poison and Psychic damage and to all conditions. They automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws. An object reduced to 0 HP is destroyed.",
