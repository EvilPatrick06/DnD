The creature has Disadvantage on Attack Rolls against targets other than the Grappler. The Grappler can drag or carry the Grappled creature when the Grappler moves, but every foot of movement costs 1 extra foot unless the Grappled creature is Tiny or two or more Sizes smaller than the Grappler. The condition ends if the Grappler is Incapacitated or if an effect removes the Grappled creature from the reach of the Grappler or grappling effect.",
