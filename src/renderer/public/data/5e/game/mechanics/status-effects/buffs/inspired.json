    "Rolling a 1 on a d20 Test (natural 1) grants Heroic Inspiration in 2024 rules",
    "DM award for excellent roleplaying, clever problem-solving, or heroic actions",
    "Certain class features and backgrounds may grant it",
    "Human species trait grants Heroic Inspiration when you finish a Long Rest"
  ],
  "rules": [
    "You can have only one instance of Heroic Inspiration at a time",
    "If you gain Heroic Inspiration when you already have it, you can give it to another player character",
    "You decide to use it after rolling the d20 but before the DM announces the outcome",

  "notes": "Heroic Inspiration replaces the Inspiration mechanic from the 2014 rules. The key difference is you reroll (must use new result) rather than gaining Advantage."
