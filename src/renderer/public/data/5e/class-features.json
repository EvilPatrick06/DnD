        "description": "You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.\n\nYou can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level: 2 (1st level), 3 (3rd), 4 (6th), 5 (12th), 6 (17th). You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nWhile active, your Rage follows these rules:\n- Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.\n- Rage Damage. When you make an attack using Strength — with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike — and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage: +2 (1st level), +3 (9th), +4 (16th).\n- Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\n- No Concentration or Spells. You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.\n- Duration. The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend it by: making an attack roll against an enemy, forcing an enemy to make a saving throw, or taking a Bonus Action to extend your Rage. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes."
